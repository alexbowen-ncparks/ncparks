# DPR Next Gen Sustainability User Guide
> Newly Migrated System and DPR Cal Rewrite - Spring 2022

This document will serve as a general user guide for all roles in the DPR Cal application. There will be step-by-step instructions for all implemented use cases for admin, instructor, and attendees. There will be instructions for how to start interacting with our application along with in-depth guides and visuals (included in the standalone document version) to help navigate through every step of the way.

## Sign-In and User Profiles
When first accessing the new DPR Cal, you will first see the new log-in page for all user authentication.

From this log-in screen, the user can log-in with their valid credentials. Our authentication system will then route the user to the appropriate landing page: Admin, Instructor, or Attendee.
