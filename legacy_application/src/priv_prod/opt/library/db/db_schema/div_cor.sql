She agreed that it would be best\r\nfor her to end her term now and possibly come back to serve a term in\r\nthe future when she has the time.  Another member who was scheduled to\r\ncycle off this year was willing to stay for the full three year term. \r\n(I established this PAC in August 2007 - so the terms were staggered\r\nwith some serving one or two years).  I hope that does not cause any\r\nproblems.\r\nLast year, when I established the PAC, Lewis\' only negative comment was\r\nthat all but one of my recommendations were from Guilford County.  So, I\r\nhave replaced one of the exiting members with a Rockingham county resident.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any concerns, or if I need to make any\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSue\r\n\r\nPS: See you Wednesday at 9am.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nSue McBean\r\nPark Superintendent\r\nHaw River State Park\r\n336-342-6163\r\nsusan.mcbean@ncmail.net\r\n339 Conference Center Drive\r\nBrown Summit, NC  27214\r\n','forwarded to Dir.Office','7/25/08','electronic','OPS 08 PAC','complete','','','file_upload/HARI PAC+2008+contact.doc,file_upload/HARI+PAC+Recomm+2008-1.doc','','2008-07-25 14:39:56','Williams5894'),(80,'Operations','2008-07-21','email','DISU\'s','Greg','Arch','HR FORM FOR BEACON ISSUES','District Superintendents;\r\n\r\nThis is a spreadsheet that Mosella has provided for each of the\r\ndistricts to compile and forward their BEACON issues to her office. \r\nThis is similar to the report generated by Tom and Julie in the West\r\nDistrict recently.

This is part of her exciting EE Certification Action Partnership, which will help get visitors excited about exploring our state parks system.  Your park may already have a stamp that would be appropriate for the passport, or you may already have artwork that would be appropriate.  The stamps will likely need to be around 2x2 inches or smaller.   Please see JoAnn\'s message below for more details. \r\n\r\nEach park should email JoAnn and cc: Denise Williams to let them know:\r\n(1) if you have a stamp already that you would like to use\r\n(2) if you already have artwork that you would like to make into your stamp\r\n(3) if you do not have a stamp or artwork, but have an idea for an animal or image you would like to see as your stamp.\r\n\r\nIf you have a stamp or artwork, please attach it to the reply as a PDF or JPEG file and email a response to joann@burtness.net and denise.williams@ncmail.net by Friday, August 15th. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated in this Environmental Education Passport Program Project.   \r\n\r\nThanks for your support.\r\nSean Higgins\r\nInterpretive Education Program Manager\r\nOperations Section\r\n\r\n\r\n> Forwarded Message From JoAnn Burtness\r\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> In order to complete my Environmental Education Certification Program, I will be coordinating a marketing campaign for the North Carolina State Parks System.  The campaign will consist of a Passport to North Carolina Parks.  The participants will be able to obtain the passport from each of the 40 parks in North Carolina.  Upon visiting each park, participants will receive a unique dated rubber stamp representing wildlife, scenery, or natural beauty found in that location.  Participants will also have the option to purchase a beautiful color printed stamp to place in their book to commemorate their visit to the park.\r\n>  \r\n> I have included some sample ideas for rubber stamps and collector?s stamps for some of the parks.  These are just ideas and in no way final.  I would greatly appreciate input from the staff at each park of one or two suggestions of what wildlife or icon would highlight their park.  If the park has a logo, that they would like to be used for their stamp, please forward those to me as well.  In addition, I would appreciate beautiful color photos from each of the parks for the optional collector?s stamp.  Please forward creative ideas and artwork to my e-mail address and put Passport in the subject line.\r\n>  \r\n> My e-mail address is: joann@burtness.net. \r\n>  \r\n> Thank you and the Park Educators and Rangers for assistance in coordinating the marketing program and help in completing my Action Project.\r\n>  \r\n> Sincerely,\r\n> JoAnn Burtness\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>       \r\n\r\n\r\n','see email dated 8/6/08 from DW for Sean.

I would like to make a suggestion however. In the sprite of consistency how about _all_ parks have a stamp using the Naturally Wonderful logo and arched across the top is the park name and arched around the bottom is the name of the town in which the park is located.\r\n\r\n> Scott Kershner, Park Supt Falls Lake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecky Holmes 8/6/08\r\nSounds fun.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great for the artwork for this stamp to be the same as the artwork for the Junior Ranger Program.  Even if a park doesn\'t have a JURA program right now, by designing a stamp for this the art work could then be used for the JURA too.  This will create somewhat of a brand image for the individual park for both programs.\r\nDo people buy a passport or is it something that is paper and just given to them?\r\nThat\'s my few cents,\r\n~Becky\r\n\r\n\\\\8/6/08\r\nThis is a fantastic idea!\r\nThanks,\r\nJay\r\nMEMI\r\n\r\n8/7/08 I agree with Becky, that it should correlate to the JURA patch.  The stamp could be used at festivals and other outreach events and help promote the JURA program.  Plus having a unique stamp at each park is more enticing to those stamp collectors :)!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKelly L. Hoke\r\n\r\n8/8/08 I am going to ask the Eno River Association if we can use their logo which is a in Indian Pipe (the plant) and an oak leaf.  I meet with their board of directors on the 14th.\r\n	\r\nDave Cook \r\n8/12/08 We do not currently have a stamp or any artwork, however we do have a \r\nfew suggestions of images that could be put on the stamp.   We think \r\nthat a cypress tree, a yellow perch, a canoe, a fence lizard, or a red-\r\ncockaded woodpecker would all be good choices.\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\n\r\nShane Freeman, Park Superintendent\r\nJones Lake State Park\r\n\r\n8/11/08\r\nPam\r\nThis is an awesome graphic for the stamp project.  Thank you for sharing it\r\nwith us.  I also greatly appreciate Kevin volunteering his help with editing\r\nthe artwork as it is (potentially) going to be a huge job.  This is the\r\ndesign we will use for your park.  I need Kevin\'s help with getting the park\r\nmap the right size for printing the booklet.  I will forward the information\r\nto Kevin.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nJoAnn\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Pam Pearson [mailto:pam.pearson@ncmail.net] \r\nSent: Friday, August 08, 2008 10:28 AM\r\n\r\nGood Morning Denise and Joann,\r\n\r\nI have attached a .jpeg file for the NC passport program for Hammocks \r\nBeach State Park. The file is the artwork we use for our patch, as well \r\nas our Junior. ranger program. The consensus of park staff is that this \r\nwould be most representative of our park. We would appreciate your \r\nsending us a proof of the stamp to view prior to it going to print. \r\nAlso, Ranger Kevin Bleck, who did the attached, has a program that can \r\nproduce professional looking artwork. He would be happy to assist any \r\npark in designing a stamp for the passport program. Please have any park \r\ninterested in his assistance to contact Kevin by phone or by email.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a good day!\r\n\r\nPam\r\n\r\n-- \r\n8/8/08\r\nThanks for your thoughts and interest in the program.  Here\'s some thoughts re: Becky\'s questions.\r\n\r\n1) We\'ll aim to be consistent with the park for which we already have a Junior Ranger patch.  \r\nJordan Lake\r\nGoose Creek\r\nHammocks Beach\r\nMount Mitchell\r\nNew River\r\nPettigrew\r\nSouth Mountains (design in progress)\r\nCarolina Beach (design in progress)\r\n\r\nFor the other parks, we can be consistent by maintaining the circular shape like the Junior Rangers patches and similar font that reads \"Raven Rock State Park\".  However, we may need to create more simple stamps initially than our existing patches. Our Junior Ranger patches are great, but it would probably too long for us to create 25 new patches that have as much detail as the existing Junior Ranger patches.  I think that we all (including JoAnn) would like to see this program ready to go in 2009.   These will also likely be \"desktop rubber stamps\".  That way, we know we won\'t run out of them.  In this case, only one color is needed. \r\n\r\n2) We will likely have a first round of passports printed out professionally.  We\'ll also likely have a certain amount of them that we can give out for free to visitors who express a real interest in the program.  If the program become very popular, we may eventually ask folks to purchase them at the cost of printing.\r\n\r\nSean Higgins\r\nLead Interpretation and Education Specialist\r\nNorth Carolina State Parks\r\n(919)-715-0047\r\nsean.higgins@ncmail.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGIN:VCARD\r\nVERSION:3.0\r\nN:Higgins;Sean;;;\r\nFN:Sean Higgins\r\nORG:NC State Parks;\r\nEMAIL;type=INTERNET;type=HOME;type=pref:sean.higgins@ncmail.net\r\nTEL;type=HOME;type=pref:919-715-0047\r\nitem1.ADR;type=HOME;type=pref:;;1615 MSC;Raleigh;NC;27699;United States\r\nitem1.X-ABADR:us\r\nX-ABUID:E78EBE6A-C865-4AA1-AA03-0007BA03BA6D\\:ABPerson\r\nEND:VCARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Aug 7, 2008, at 10:17 AM, kelly hoke wrote:\r\n\r\n> I agree with Becky, that it should correlate to the JURA patch.

Thank you for thinking of state parks when you were deciding on your partner for this endeavor.\r\nThis sounds like an excellent project.  At Lumber River State Park I guess we fall into option # 3 in Sean\'s email informing us of your project.  We don\'t have a stamp or any artwork already prepared to be used in a project of this sort.  I think either a Wood Duck or a Great Blue Heron would be an excellent symbol for the Lumber River.  The Great Blue might not be represented in all its grandeur on a 2 x 2 stamp so I would lean towards the Wood Duck as a very good symbol to be placed on a Lumber River stamp.  It is fairly common on the river yearround but although it is more common than some of the rarer species that visitors might work harder to see, it is such a beautiful bird that every time you see it, it leaves quite an impression.  Does this sound appropriate to you and give you the information you need to develop a stamp for Lumber River?  If I can provide you with any more information, please let me know.  When you can, come visit the park and we\'ll get you out on the river to see some of the wood ducks and the other species that call the river home.  April is a great time to see them with their newly hatched ducklings swimming across the river.  Again, thanks for this great project.\r\n\r\nNeill Lee, Park Superintendent\r\nLumber River State Park \r\n\r\nThis is the stamp created for Medoc Mountain State Park.  I have \r\nattached it as a photoshop document.  If you need it in a different \r\nformat please let me know.  I think what you are doing is Wonderful!!\r\n\r\n-- Nicole Crider Park Ranger/ I&E Specialist Medoc Mountain State Park 252-586-6588\r\n\r\nHere is the passport stamp idea from Lake Waccamaw.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMartha\r\n\r\n--\r\nMartha Flanagan\r\nJoAnn,\r\n\r\nThis is such a great idea! Carolina Beach State Park would love to participate by submitting artwork that can be made into a stamp, however cannot meet today\'s deadline. We should be able to send you something by Wednesday, August 20. The image will be of a Venus flytrap. We will also be able to send you several color photos at the same time.\r\n\r\nI hope this will work for you.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing the finished project!\r\n\r\nTerri Taylor, Park Superintendent\r\nCarolina Beach State Park\r\nHello from CRMO!\r\n\r\nAttached is the design we would like to use for the passport program.  Please let me know if you have any trouble pulling it up.\r\n\r\nHave a great weekend.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKaren Johnson, Office Assistant\r\nCrowders Mountain State Park\r\n704-853-5375 \r\nJoann:\r\nI am so excited that you are creating a passport program for NC state parks!  I have thought about that for quite a while - that is a great EE Cert. project.\r\nWe had a contest here at HARI and I have a design for you.  I am afraid that it may be too detailed for such a small stamp, but I am hoping that it will work.  If not, I can work with you to come up with something that will work.\r\nHowever, my computer does not have access to the scanner, so I will need to wait until Monday to send you a scanned image.

He shared the screen you sent him in BEACON, and they have advised that it does not matter what is stated in the BEACON system, changes must be made in the ORBIT system by an HR representative.  They also need to know the total contributions he has put into the TSERS system that should have gone into the LEORS system.  I know you all are busy, but this seems to be an issue that we cannot resolve at the park level and, of course is an extremely important issue to get resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Michael is finally set up in the 401-K plan, but there have been no employer deposits made to the account, I assume because he is not yet recognized in the LEORS system.  Arrangements will need to be made to put in the 2nd quarter\'s 5% allotment, and the 2 month\'s of the 3rd quarter that have now gone by, into his account.\r\nAnd one further issue that has still not been resolved is the matter of the back pay for the 5% raise he should have gotten on April 1.  He did receive his raise in the July check, but did not receive the backpay for June that I was told by Teresa he would get, nor the April or May backpay that he is owed.  \r\nI know that none of these are new issues, since I have been listing them on the spreadsheet for the past 6 weeks, and you are probably working on them already, but if you could please take another look, and advise me of a course of action and a time frame, I would certainly appreciate it.   Understandably, Michael is very interested in seeing some progress on this, as it has now been 5 months since he was commissioned.  If you need any additional information from me, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJonathan\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJonathan Griffith, Superintendent\r\nSouth Mountains State Park\r\n3001 South Mountain Park Ave\r\nConnelly Springs, NC  28612\r\n(828) 433-4772\r\n(828) 433-4778  fax\r\nJonathan.Griffith@ncmail.net\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\nJulie Bunn <julie.bunn@ncmail.net>\r\nEnvironment and Natural Resources\r\nDivision of Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Original Message --------\r\nSubject:     Re: Michael Eisch Retirement\r\nDate:     Mon, 25 Aug 2008 13:01:18 -0400 (EDT)\r\nFrom:     Mosella.Jamerson@ncmail.net <Mosella.Jamerson@ncmail.net>\r\nReply-To:     Mosella.Jamerson@ncmail.net <Mosella.Jamerson@ncmail.net>\r\nTo:     <jonathan.griffith@ncmail.net>, Carrie Paige <Carrie.Paige@ncmail.net>\r\nCC:     Tom Jackson <Tom.Jackson@ncmail.net>, Julie Bunn <julie.bunn@ncmail.net>, don.reuter@ncmail.net, greg.schneider@ncmail.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have in fact been working on this issue (i.e the screen shot that was provided by me on Friday). I am not sure why he is getting the response from retirement system as ORBIT is their system and we do not as HR have any access to it. Can you please provide me with the name and number of the person Michael is speaking to at Retirement so maybe I can offer them some clarity on the situation.\r\n\r\nTo be noted, Teresa inputted these raises into the Beacon system for the last Officer\'s that were commissioned. When I reviewed them on Friday, that actions in the Beacon system were all different and some not complete. Teresa\'s is in the process of compiling me a list of those who were supposed to received raises and how she processed the actions. They were obviously not processed correctly and as a result we have these types of issues. Once I have this list I will be able to determine what happened and how to fix it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that you are inputting this information on a spreadsheet for the last 6 weeks. Please be advised that I am working diligently on all \"OLD\" Beacon issues that existed before I came on board. Each one requires me to research the actual problem and then come up with a solution.

At current staffing levels, it is unrealistic to offer an on-demand service during all hours that the park is open.\r\n\r\nWith the current staff, the park could offer transportation service every day, with limited hours.  This would be during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., from April through November, with an advance notice of 24 hours. Visitors without a reservation would be accommodated if staff is available to do so. This is similar to the current JORI operational plan offering transportation to the top of the dune.   \r\n\r\nAn on-demand service during all hours of operation would require additional staffing. With three additional seasonal positions, service could be provided from April through November, from open to close, including up to 13 hours a day of operation during the summer months.  The service would be discontinued during the worst inclement weather months of December through March. \r\n\r\nThe additional staffing request would consist of three Park Technician positions, two for 8 months, and one for 6 months. If these positions were to be filled their full terms, the cost would be $27,752. This is the minimum staffing level needed in order to respond to both scheduled and unscheduled transport requests in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there will be time periods when this service cannot be offered due to issues such as equipment malfunctions, inclement weather, staff being deployed elsewhere, or their positions being vacant. \r\n\r\nAfter having seen the width and the grade of the trail accessing the tower, I believe we should work with the Division Safety Officer in the development of an operations plan for the transportation of disabled individuals, and the training of the vehicle operators.  \r\n\r\nTLJ/tlj\r\n\r\ncc:	Jack Bradley, Park Superintendent\r\n\r\nSigned copy retained at the West District Office\r\n','2/25/09 Mike,\r\nPlease find attached the MOMI Observation Deck ADA Transport Guidelines.

No employee is too insignificant to be vital to the Division, because all our employees are necessary to get the job done.\r\n \r\nTherefore, in honor of your years of service, effective November 1, 2008, I want you to know that your enduring works are acknowledged and appreciated continually.  Therefore please review the selection contract information attached and provide your item # and description selection to Sherry so that one list can be provided to me no later than Wednesday, October 8, 2008. \r\n \r\nYOU ARE IMPORTANT!\r\n\r\nsorry for the delay in asking you to make your selection; however, the BEACON system works differently and it took more time than expected to verify all eligible employees. \r\n\r\nPlease submit directly to me.

Garrard, III\r\n440 College Avenue\r\nAthens, GA 30601\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Garrard:\r\n\r\nYour letter of September 2, 2008 to General Council Mary Penny Thompson was referred to me for investigation and response.  I regret that your recent visit to Gorges State Park was not an entirely pleasant one. As you now realize, the Grassy Ridge section of the park is currently closed for the construction of roads and parking lots in preparation for future facilities. A public notice was placed on the division web site in advance of the closure.  In addition, news releases were employed, an informational brochure was developed and distributed, and the Department of Transportation signs directing the public to the Grassy Ridge entrance were removed. The projected reopening of this park section is mid-November, 2008.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand your belief that the citations you and your son received should be voided, it is not the practice of our agency to request dismissal of a citation or case made by a division officer without compelling evidence of inappropriate conduct by the involved officer. I have directed the Western District Superintendent to discuss the towing of vehicles from state park property with the Gorges State Park Superintendent. As of today, your visit on August 31 has been the only occasion when a tow truck has been dispatched to the park in response to a parking issue. \r\n\r\nI do understand your concerns and truly regret your visit to Gorges State Park was not satisfactory. I hope that you and your family will make a return visit when the park fully reopens to the public.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n','emailed cc: to Tom J, Steve P, Mary P.

I have come to a directive to ensure we are in compliance. If we are not in compliance the consequences are that we will not receive approvals to enter employees into the system. This will cause a delay in paychecks.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we do not create any new hire actions after the 10th of the month. This will ensure that we can receive the paperwork from the field, enter the action and receive approval. This includes Temporaries.\r\n\r\nIf we do need to hire someone after the 10th then it needs to be communicated by the hiring supervisor to the new employee when they can expect their first paycheck.\r\n\r\nEx. A temporary is hired on the Sept. 18 they will not receive their first check until the next pay period which is Oct 17th. This is due to the fact that we will not receive an approval to hire until Oct 1st. This is common in most industries that have a bi-weekly payroll. (work a pay period in the hole)\r\n\r\nPermanent new hires can be controlled much better. As we are paid monthly and it makes sense to start someone at the beginning of the month. Of course there are going to be exceptions and each one should be dealt with on a case by case basis so that we can ensure the new hire action is approved by DENR HR.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other suggestions please let me know. I need to get something in place for this months as we the deadline from DENR HR is fast approaching. Thank you for all your support.

November 17 is a hard deadline, each of you must bring this information to the Superintendent\'s Conference.\r\nThanks you for your help in making the central reservation system the best that it can be!\r\n\r\nGreg Schneider','','','electronic','Scott Kershner FALA','complete','','','file_upload/Park Campsite Inventory.pdf,file_upload/Shelter Inventory Profile.pdf,file_upload/General Instructions to Complete Inventory Forms-1.doc','','2008-12-05 17:30:45','Williams5894'),(262,'Operations','2008-10-21','mail','CHOP','George Greene','Goldsboro NC','McCoy Family Reunion at SILA/SODI CORRESPONDENCE','cc of letter to SUPT at SILA asking for a copy of State Procedures Manual regarding use of State Parks.

Be sure that the budget database is updated frequently (at least weekly) as to what items have been ordered, received, and paid for.  It is imperative that we move forward with these purchases as quickly as is possible.  As you look through your database, you may find a few items that have been disapproved by Tammy or myself and an explanation or direction.  I did find a few things as I was checking the datatbase.  Please let your district superintendent know when you have fixed the the following items so that they can approve any additional equipment requests.  District Superintendents should let me know when all requests are finished for their district so that I can then approve for purchase.\r\n\r\nShederick - JORD:  er# 3734 Interactive Computer System ?- is this a new exhibit for the lobby?  also, there is a cash register on the list.  With the new central reservation system there will be a point of sale function and electronic cash drawer established at all entrance stations and the park office, so no cash register will be needed.  If you do need the Interactive Computer System, let me know and I will approve it.  If you do not need the Interactive Computer System then you will need to request  $7,750.00 worth of equipment that you need in conjunction with the new Visitor\'s Center.\r\nAngelia - CACR:  you have up to an additional $2,516.35 that you should request.\r\n\r\nLarry - CRMO - you can purchase the two folding tables that did not get purchased last year.\r\n\r\nJay - MEMI -  You have up to an additional $10,152.89 that you should request.  I only saw one request for a hand held radio, will you need additional radios for the permanent staff that you will be getting?\r\n\r\nLyndon - SARU - You have up to an additional $4,484.00 that you should request.  I also do not have any requests for radios for this full time ranger.\r\n\r\nTim - MOMO - You have up to an additional $1,600.00 that you should request.\r\n\r\nThanks for your hard work on these requests.

It appears that the relationship has been beneficial.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI personally do not have a signed copy of the extension that was discussed last December.  The original agreement was signed in June of 2009 so the extension should be valid through June 2011.  I know that Lew and Crae discussed some renewal options last year.  Carol may have a copy of the extension.  I?ll check with her. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAre you requesting a letter of support to continue the agreement through June 2012?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMichael D.

He would like to take to them something from Lewis that will let them know that we are interested in continuing the trails agreement with them that Lewis and Crae Morton signed last year.  They signed a one year extension to an original agreement.  Penn would like to have something in writing (a proposal was his suggestion) that he can take to the board.  This probably does not even have to come from Lewis, but from you or Carol (higher than me).  His interest in continuing this agreement is in the interest of the state park: their trails crew has done a great amount of work on the Profile trail this year and our working relationship has been very positive and productive.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need any further information. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nSue\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSue McBean\r\n\r\nPark Superintendent','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_10/RE_GRMO_trails_agreement_extension_request_10202010.htm,file_upload/2010_10/RE_GRMO_trails_agreement_extension_request_10202010.htm','','2010-10-27 11:46:06','Williams5894'),(371,'Operations','2008-12-09','email','ALL DISU\'s','Erik Nygard','OPS','Check the Database for Errors and Updates','To, Angelia, Tom and Adrian,\r\n\r\nI suggest you go into the vacant positions database and check to see that all your vacancies are posted and updated correctly.

Director Ledford responded that he was unaware of the change and requested that PASU Farr research the issue and forward information. PASU Farr submitted a memo through me to you dated 11/21/08 in which he makes the case that park staff do qualify for on-call compensation under OSP policy, section 4, page 69, addressing On-Call / Emergency Call-Back. I have held PASU Farr\'s memorandum as I researched this issue myself.\r\n\r\nWhat I found was that a discrepancy exists between the OSP Policy dated 10/1/2008 and current DENR policy dated 8/4/1997. Division Staff Directive 90-10 uses the term Stand-By, as does the current 1997 DENR policy. The 2008 OSP policy no longer utilizes this term; instead utilizes the terms On-Call and Emergency Call-Back. It appears that the OSP definition of On-Call describes the current SOP in many of our parks concerning after-hours emergency responses. The OSP policy states: On-Call is when an employee must remain available to be called back to work on short notice if the need arises.\r\nSince the current division stand-by & on-call policy is based on the eighteen-year-old SD 90-10, I believe that we should discuss this question with DENR HR in order to determine if in fact our stand-by policy is compliant with the updated OSP policy. If SD 90-10 is not in compliance with the current OSP policy, we should work together with DENR HR to develop a internal procedure. I am willing to work on this issue with DPR / DENR HR staff in order to draft an updated procedure / staff directive.\r\n\r\nAttached is PASU Farr\'s memorandum, SD 90-10, SD 97-12, the current DENR policy addressing stand-by status, and the current OSP policy addressing on-call / emergency call-back.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom  \r\n\r\n1-14-09  From Erik to M.Lambert CHOP:\r\ncopy of email uploaded (fwd copy)Mike,\r\n\r\nThis is an important policy that I believe needs to be addressed by the CHOP in the near future.  As a superintendent I\'m sure you were aware of this inconsistency.  As Acting CHOP I didn\'t believe it would be appropriate for me to address this and then leave it for you to finish.  If you want me to move it forward I will.

Right now, we do not pay it and will only pay when the renewal comes due minus the cost of a regular license.  To me, there is no difference in paying this compared to all the cost we pay for a ranger.  The maintenance council is asking why we can\'t pay for the original CDL because we pay for any all their other certification such as wastewater etc.  Allowing this will really help out some of the lowest paid park employees to get started in their state careers!

As a result, DENR has established additional Purchasing Guidelines for our Division. Under the NEW Guidelines, all DPR employees must obtain Division Director Approval for certain Direct Purchases regardless of Dollar amount. This NEW Approval process is for Direct Purchases only & does NOT include:\r\n\r\n1) Travel Purchases (Approved thru other processes)\r\n\r\n2) Approved Equipment Purchases  (Approved thru other processes)\r\n\r\n3) Purchases already encumbered under existing Purchase Orders  (already Approved)\r\n\r\n4) Purchases for Utilities, including: a) water  b) sewer  c) electricity  d) gas  e) propane,                                                              f) oil,  g) waste removal,  h) other Utilities\r\n\r\n5) Purchases for Approved Projects (Major Maintenance, Trail Maintenance, Capital Improvement, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll other Purchases not listed above must be Approved by Director Ledford prior to purchase.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Director Ledford is required to submit our Division\'s Approved Purchase List to DENR every Friday.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate this NEW Weekly Approval Process, we have created an ONLINE Tool to assist all Division staff.\r\n\r\nOperations Section:\r\nAll Purchase Requests for your Section must be:\r\n\r\na) Submitted Online by Field Staff\r\nb) Approved Online by DISU\r\nc) Approved Online by CHOP\r\n\r\nFINAL Approval by the CHOP is necessary by 5:00 PM each Thursday to ensure Purchase Requests can be reviewed by the Director\'s Office each Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign & Development Section:\r\n\r\nAll Purchases should be Approved by D&D Section Chief.  Requests should be entered ONLINE by D&D Office Assistant before 5:00 PM each Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL Other Sections (Trails, Natural Resources, Administration):\r\n\r\nContact Rachel Gooding to have your Purchase Requests entered ONLINE by 5:00 PM each Thursday.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY Purchases:\r\n\r\nUnder those Rare Occurrences of Emergency, Division Staff may make purchases prior to Approval if the Cost is less than $2500 & the situation is an Emergency:\r\n\r\nEmergency:  Involves Risk to Public Health/ Human Safety and/or Failure to Act will result in significant additional cost.\r\n\r\nHowever, those Emergency Purchases must still be entered ONLINE. There will be a place in the Online Tool to indicate the purchase was an Emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\nONLINE Instructions:\r\nFor Specific Instructions on utilizing the Division\'s ONLINE Tool, see Budget Forum 72\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) Budget Officer Dodd was consulted to ensure compliance with DENR Guidelines. She has made every effort to consult with DENR to clarify their Guidelines & limit any unnecessary work for our Division.\r\n\r\n2) Acting CHOP Niggard was consulted to assist with the ONLINE Tools necessary for the Operations Section.\r\n\r\n3) Thanks to Tom Howard for simplifying this process, wherever possible thru Online Internet Tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTony P Bass ','n/a','n/a','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/Request for Exception to Purchase3.doc,file_upload/PositionExemption Form.doc,file_upload/1-20-09 [Fwd  RE  WEDI Funded Seasonal Positions Requiring Beacon Numbers].eml.html,file_upload/1-22-09 Director update [Fwd  [Fwd  Purchasing Process]].eml.html,file_upload/Change In Purchasing Process 1-22-09.eml.html,file_upload/Justification for purchases-1.xls,file_upload/1-23-09 A O[Fwd  Purchasing Process].eml.html,file_upload/UPDATE 1-23-09[Fwd  [Fwd  Purchasing Process]].eml.html,file_upload/URGENT  Permanent Vacancies_ New Temporary Positions.eml.html,file_upload/Weekly Purchase Log 1_30_09.eml.html,file_upload/budget_memo 2-2-09.doc','','2009-02-19 12:40:14','Williams5894'),(443,'Operations','2009-01-21','email','FYI','Tom Jackson','WEDI','LANO and MOMI Drug Testing forms and communication with HR 1/21/09','FYI','','','','','complete','','','','','2009-01-21 18:30:22','Williams5894'),(444,'Operations','2009-01-21','email','FYI','Tom Jackson','WEDI','LANO and MOMI Drug Testing forms and communication with HR 1/21/09','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/1-21-09 WEDI  Drug Testing Of New Employees.eml','','2009-01-21 18:29:36','Williams5894'),(445,'Operations','2009-01-21','email','CHOP in WVA','Mike Lambert','','LANO TRAIL and FACILITY NAME REQUEST ','EMAIL AND PDF DOC FROM MIKE','FORWARDED TO DR 1/21/09','1/21/09 DW','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/[Fwd  Fw  LANO Trail Facility Name Request].eml.html,file_upload/LANO Trail Facility Name Request 1-20-09.pdf,file_upload/1-21-09 email LANO Trail Facility Name Request 1-20-09.pdf,file_upload/1-20-09 email reLANO Trail Facility Name Request.eml.html','','2009-01-21 18:55:59','Williams5894'),(446,'Operations','2009-01-21','email','CHOP','Sean Higgins','I & E','EMAIL FROM SEAN REGARDING MEMOS-  MEMOS WERE NOT ATTACHED','','ADDED TO CORRESP TO DO...','','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/Email regarding memos from I&E-not attached CHOP Transition.eml.html','','2009-01-26 13:54:45','Williams5894'),(447,'Operations','2009-01-21','email','DIR','Erik Nygard','','CRMO Request to Operate The Boulders Access','Sorry for the late e-mail.

Questions that have been asked are listed with an answer.   We will continue to update the FAQ as often as we can.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for a smooth transition, we urge to you do the following activities at your earliest convenience:\r\n\r\n   1. Clean-up your e-mail folders by deleting any unneeded messages you are not required to keep for business or legal reasons. Please pay close attention to your division?s records retention policy when determining which e-mail messages are unneeded. You can find the most current records retention policy for your division on DENR?s portal at http://portal.ncdenr.org/group/denr/rr .\r\n   2. Clean-up address books by deleting any contacts you do not need and are not required to keep for business or legal reasons.\r\n   3. Clean-up calendars by deleting any unneeded contacts, resources, tasks and groups you are not required to keep for business or legal reasons.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous information:\r\n\r\n   1. Training material is being prepared and added to the DENR Universe.  You will be notified when this material is available to you.\r\n   2. Everyone will be required to complete training for the Outlook clients and the Outlook Calendar.\r\n   3. Introductory sessions on DENR Universe are scheduled for January 23, 2009.  This will be the best time to get information on how to access the training materials.\r\n   4. All DENR Technical Support staff will participate in a Technical Share session on January 15, 2009.  This will be their orientation on the migration strategies and things they should do to prepare.\r\n   5. Continue to check the Migration FAQs for new questions and answers.\r\n   6. Very soon a link will be added to the DENR Intranet Portal for information on the Email Migration project. \r\n\r\nWe estimate that the migration process will start the week of Jan. 26, 2009.  You will receive additional information prior to the start of the migration regarding the expected schedule of migration for your business unit.

Do you have a contact to call.  I have not had a chance to discuss with Bruce in the office again.  The remark I see on the field inspection, Schnabel Engineering, indicates we need to get their approval for any alteration on the structures.  We can perform maintenance on the structures.  It indicates both structures and bypass channel should be cleared of trees and brush.  I would encourage you to start on this as best you can.  The letter indicates, perhaps mistakenly, NC DENR does not regulate the dams at MARI.  It indicates a suitable principal spillway should be designed and constructed.  I suspect the $75,000 figure is low ball from what I have seen in other projects compared to what is at MARI.

Nevertheless, an entity was created by the Jordan PAC so that monies donated by parties interested in the park could be accepted.  It was noted by the MARI PAC that something like that needs to be done for this park.  They had requested of me to look into it and provide them with a way to proceed by the next meeting.

After all is said and \r\ndone, it appears that we should proceed as we had previously decided \r\nwith the use of distance learning methods to accomplish our learning \r\nobjectives for session IV-HR Topics.  \r\n\r\nThis final decision will have the least impact on the division\'s and \r\nyour personal financial resources.  However, completing our work \r\ntogether using distance learning methods will mean that YOU will have \r\nto dedicate additional time in the coming weeks to completing your \r\nassignments in a timely manner.  Distance learning is not always the \r\nquickest learning method, and in some cases, actually takes more time \r\nthan when learning is presented during in-person sessions.  I am \r\nexploring low or no cost resources and tools for the delivery of our \r\nlearning materials and activities.   \r\n\r\nI will continue with my design and development work for the \r\nalternative learning methods.  I\'m thinking I will need at least two \r\nweeks to have your assignments ready to distribute.  I am planning on \r\nusing OPAL as a resource, so please go to the OPAL link and make sure \r\nyou can log in.  The link is:\r\n\r\nhttp://opal.ncstate.ddiworld.com/signon.asp?\r\n\r\nAttached is the list of user names.  The password is opal.  \r\n\r\n17 of you have taken and successfully passed the exam.

I know there is a lot going on in your \r\nworkplaces, but remember to schedule time to complete your program \r\nrequirements.  The deadline for your papers, exam, and memorandums is \r\nMarch 1st.\r\n\r\nAgain, let me express my appreciation for your passion and commitment \r\nto our program.

I will help them help the parks with the task.\r\n\r\nI have attached instructions for the new PAC Database that Tom Howard has created a time saving database to reduce  and assist in organizing and maintaining records and information.  This will improve the nomination/appointment tracking system and archives for each PARK PAC along with the ability to upload word and pdf docs from PAC meetings, and help the District Superintendents and CHOP stay updated with the statewide PAC information. \r\n\r\nThe District OA\'s can help us train the Park Superintendents and OA\'s that will enter and maintain PAC member data and meeting information.  Please go to the PAC Database...take a look and review the instruction process for updating this old information.....Then we need to add PAC members that are missing from your current PAC list.  Finally, we need to process nominations through this database.\r\n\r\nAfter the requested data entry has been completed in the parks...by 2/20/09(deadline)   Tom Howard can test the approval procedure from the park to the district office to the CHOP then Director.\r\n\r\nOnce the approval process has been successfully tested we will provide report access to include PAC meeting dates, PAC Meeting document upload(ex. meeting minutes, etc.)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or need assistance...call me anytime the PAC HOTLINE :-)   919-715-7616 will be available as soon as you start looking at the database so call me!\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if the DISU\'s would contact their Parks and attach/or add my instructions to meet the Database deadline of 2/20/09.

This in my mind is a questionable request as it is a high liability line of work, not that what we do isn\'t, but that potentially might interfere with the ranger\'s primary role, ie schedule conflicts, training needs conflicts, he will have to learn policies that might get mistakenly overlapped in the course of conflict.  He needs to be rested to be able to do his primary job.  I would consider being a jailer as stressful work.  Would he come to his DPR job to relax from his jailer job?  It is also in the community in which the ranger perhaps lives and works.  Is there a possibility the community will begin to recognize him as the ranger who is a jailer.

It was one of 61 field unit prisons renovated or built during the late 1930\'s to house inmates who worked building roads. In November 2001 it was converted back to a minimum security prison for adult males, to help meet the department\'s growing need for adult bed space.\r\n>\r\n> The prison\'s original dormitory is still used.

Classes for adult education and preparation for the GED tests are available. Inmates may also take a course on substance abuse.\r\n>\r\n> Inmates work in a number of jobs. They may be assigned to Department of Transportation road crews or as maintenance or kitchen help at the prison.

The current balance in the seasonal operating budget for each park is available to use throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.  Please ensure that spending is routinely tracked at the park level to ensure that there are no budget deficits.  Please ask staff to follow HR guidelines for required documentation.  Remember that the New Hire Information Form and Supplemental Separation and Transfer Form needs to be submitted to our HR staff at a minimum of five days prior to the start date.  Verify that all seasonal staff are properly trained and oriented before beginning work, regardless of whether they are returning employees or not.  This is good news for our field operations.  I\'ve seen more interest in our seasonal positions this year primarily due to the failing economy.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike \r\n***Mosella Response***2/9/09 Mike,\r\nIn regards to HR processing, the new SOP I sent  on 1/27/09 for everyone\'s review and feedback states 7 days. This  is a more reasonable time frame, as each action (new-hire, reinstatement, etc) in the system must through DPR HR, then DENR HR, DENR Budget, OSP, Beacon and then back to us to enter Bank information, W-4, etc.  Each person in the chain has up to 5 days to complete and pass it on-(each). I have seen a new hire take 2 weeks to get through the system. This is nothing we can control. It  is simply how long it takes. 5 days is not enough time. This was the directive from the HR office last year.\r\n\r\nWe must operate on the premise -like every other hiring institution -that a person will work a pay check in the hole. This is norm for payroll processing.\r\n\r\nI just want everyone to be aware of this. I want everyone to be able to properly communicate concerning seasonal  new-hires as to when a check can be expected. When we receive multiple calls and emails concerning a new hire it takes away from other Beacon processing that could be happening at that time. More often then not, I research and find out that the paperwork was sent only 2 days prior to the start date. I am optimistic that through explaining in detail what is required to enter a person in the system we can all work together to ensure a smooth 2009 Seasonal Hiring season.\r\n','N/A','n/a','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/Seasonal Operations.eml.html,file_upload/MJ Response to ML-Seasonal Operations.eml.html','','2009-02-09 13:42:07','Williams5894'),(518,'Administration','2009-02-09','mail','DIR','Prevost','','Letter of support for Chris Mackey for deputy director position.','to Reuter, DRFD, RAM','','2/9/09','','','complete','','','','','2011-10-25 16:29:01','Eikinas5239'),(519,'Administration','2009-02-09','mail','DIR','Skinner','','Copy of letter to Dee Freeman from Skinner and Wilson, TNC re release of 08 COPS funding ','','','','','','complete','','','','','2009-07-20 18:37:30','McCoig5239'),(520,'Administration','2009-02-09','mail','DIR','Reuter','','PO1 form - GORG (Duke Energy prop, 3.7 ac.)','2/11/09 to Tingley\r\n2/16/09 to Bryant, Michaux','2/11/09 Would you confirm this meets our latest agreement, R&C, RAM','2/16/09','electronic','','complete','','','','','2009-02-16 17:06:23','McCoig5239'),(521,'Administration','2009-02-09','mail','DIR','Reuter','','PO1 form - PETT (McMullen Co prop, 288 ac, 311 ac & 510 ac.)','2/11/09 to Regier\r\n2/12/09 in\r\nto Bryant, Michaux','','2/23/09','','','complete','','','','','2009-02-16 15:59:33','McCoig5239'),(522,'Operations','2009-02-09','email','Angelia','DENISE','','Travel Authorization for R.Scarborough JORD $395.00 (paper copies)','email to Angelia asking her to forward electronic copies for tracking.','signed by M.L. placed copy in TD mailbox with note to let us know approval status','2/12/09','paper','','complete','','','file_upload/SCARBOROUGH CLASS 01-04-09.pdf,file_upload/JORD.

This road is narrow and \r\nvery steep requiring a capable vehicle with 4wd or AWD. Electronic gates \r\nwith access codes (similar to FOFI beach access) will be used for after \r\nhours access. As part of this process, Steve was tasked with developing \r\nan operational plan for the Chestnut Mountain Road access. The \r\noperational plan and access regulations are attached.

In order to follow up on this situation it would be helpful to have additional information so we could investigate this further.  Knowing the park location, ranger and the senior citizens involved we could possibly come to some resolution. .  Over thirteen million people visit our parks, recreation areas and natural areas each year.   We strive to provide a positive experience for all of them.  I am sorry that your friends felt that they were mistreated by our ranger staff.  I am available to discuss your concerns if you would like to call me at 919-733-4181.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nMike Lambert \r\n**************COMPLAINT****************To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI have feedback for the enforcement branch of NC\'s park system.  I can find no other place on the web where such feedback is requested or permitted (this may be part of the issue I describe below).  Would you be kind enough to forward my brief comments below to the appropriate state individual or organization?  Thank you.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the recent past, I have heard radio advertisements where park service representatives or commercials ask NC listeners for contributions to our state\'s parks for a variety of maintenance and other issues.  I want to respond to the state park system by saying that I could not contribute a single dime to their coffers beyond what I am forced to pay in state and federal taxes.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for this lack of further financial help is the attitude and behavior of park rangers that I--and other citizens who have discussed this issue with me--have encountered in our visits to NC parks.  By and large these officials are arrogant, immature, and deliberately intimidating to park visitors.  I will offer just one example that may give some some insight into the range of behaviors to which citizens are exposed.\r\n\r\nA senior citizen friend of mine, her husband, and another senior couple visited a NC state park.  These persons are NC natives.  That evening, the couples prepared a meal in their camper that required wine as one of the ingredients.  A young park later ranger entered their campsite unannounced(!) searching here and there with his flashlight as if he were a NY prohibitionist.  He asked the senior couples (who incidentally have probably paid more state taxes that this typical park ranger has earned in his life) if they were drinking--to which they replied \"no.\"  He then requested if he could enter their trailer, which they allowed.  \r\n\r\nWhen he entered, he immediately went to the refrigerator--apparently his \"mission\" all along--and found the half-empty wine bottle.  Having found what he wanted to find, he then made the seniors pour the wine out in his presence stating that if they didn\'t there would be legal repercussions.  He continued his arrogance with a ridiculous lecture to the visitors and stalked away into the night presumably to walk into yet another campsite and continue his intimidation.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on with examples such as this where a \'situation\' does not exist but one is summarily created by idiotic park rangers.  It is a sad commentary that our parks have now become managed as if they were squatters\' camps and citizens are treated as if they were \"perps\" on a Cops TV episode, of which park rangers must get a steady diet.\r\n\r\nIn addition, parks have become messy, not so much by paper debris but by the natural changes in vegetation that park rangers will not get out of their truck long enough to clear up because, presumably, such work is beneath them.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, the state will not get further money from this citizen, and if I am able to influence others the state park system will not get their money either.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJon\r\n','N/A','2/20/09','','','complete','','','file_upload/[Fwd  [Fwd  NC State Park Feedback]].eml.html','','2009-02-20 19:54:20','Williams5894'),(553,'Operations','2009-02-23','other','Adrienne/Rachel','ML/Denise','OPS','Mike\'s PCARD Motel Expense 2/18-2/20 Reconcile','coded and attached form for signature stamp from DIR since he approved then asked to be forwarded to Rachel for CHOP Pcard Reconcile','in AM mailbox','2/23/09','','paper/electronic copy invoice OPS accting  file','complete','','','file_upload/2-23-09 Lambert_M $135.16 Pcard-Motel-approved.pdf','','2009-02-23 13:34:47','Williams5894'),(554,'APC','2009-02-23','other','COUNCIL','Denise','OPS','APC DATABASE','This database is designed by Tom Howard for APC Council Members to upload APC Documents, Minutes, Photos, Agendas, Training information, etc.  Only council members have access to this file and any member is welcome to upload information or files for other members to view or print.

I really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nTo reiterate what we talked about on the phone, what I am thinking about is e-mailing the APC, the district OAs, Teresa McCall and Carrie Paige once each month to see if they know of any OAs who could use a get-well or sympathy card.  Then you would send the list of names for the month (if any) to Adrienne McCoig and copy Denise and me. Denise prints up blank cards and Adrienne composes a message and mails the cards out.\r\n\r\nBelow is what I sent Adrienne to use for our first batch of cards this year.  The format of this e-mail seemed to work well.  Some of these people received cards last year, but since they are still out of work, we decided to send them another.  And also, we included the director this time since he is injured. \r\n\r\nThanks again for agreeing to this.  I know how busy you are, but I thought you\'d be the best person for the job since you have such a good relationship with both the other district OAs and the HR folks. If you get to a point where you no longer have time, let me know and I\'ll see if someone else can take over.\r\n\r\nJulie\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Original Message --------\r\nSubject: 	names for APC cards\r\nDate: 	Wed, 18 Feb 2009 14:42:22 -0500\r\nFrom: 	Julie Bunn <julie.bunn@ncmail.net>\r\nOrganization: 	Division of Parks and Recreation\r\nTo: 	Mccoig, Adrienne <adrienne.mccoig@ncmail.net>\r\nCC: 	Williams, Denise <denise.williams@ncmail.net>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Adrienne,\r\n\r\nThank you again for agreeing to be the \"sender of cards\" on behalf of the APC.

Request to post\r\ndocumentation submitted on 11/16/08 to then CHOP Greg Schneider. Request to\r\nunfreeze and post documentation submitted to Denise Williams on 1/1/09. This\r\nposition is critical to provide operational coverage and management of the\r\nnew Boulders Access facility. This facility includes a 2000 sq. foot contact\r\nstation, 63 car parking lot, picnicking and access to a trail connecting\r\nCRMO to a SC state park and national park. Currently both ranger positions\r\nassigned to this new facility are vacant. Until this position is filled,\r\nthis new facility will be managed by a ranger position that is currently\r\nresponsible for all CRMO access areas as well as supervision of permanent\r\nstaff and lead ranger responsibilities. This ranger vacancy has resulted in\r\nreduced park patrol as well park staff response to emergencies to include\r\nlaw enforcement, EMS and wild fire incidents. \r\n','forwarded copies to M.J, D.R., M.L','2/24/09','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/Priority Vacancy Law Enforcement.doc','','2009-02-24 18:34:37','Williams5894'),(569,'Operations','2009-02-24','other','DENISE','Mike Lambert','','Holding Motel Receipt for Corrected(no tax)Receipt to be sent','see paper inbox','copy of the receipt emailed to pam l.with note waiting for tax to be credited.dw','3/3/09','','','complete','','','','','2009-03-03 12:25:11','Williams5894'),(570,'Administration','2009-02-24','mail','DIR','','','Letter of condolence to James Coman family.','','','2/24/09','','','complete','','','','','2009-02-24 19:35:38','McCoig5239'),(571,'Administration','2009-02-25','mail','DIR','McBane','','RE to purchase/contract RTP grant 08RTP-M06(City of Marion)$75,000.','','','','','','complete','','','','','2011-09-28 18:46:05','Eikinas5239'),(572,'Administration','2009-02-25','mail','DIR','McBane','','RE to purchase/contract RTP grant 08RTP-M10/Contrcat 1822 (Cleveland Co.) $75,000.','','','','','','complete','','','','','2011-09-28 18:46:32','Eikinas5239'),(573,'Administration','2009-02-25','mail','DIR','Strong','','PO2 - Severance of structure at FOMA (bathroom building.)','to Bryant, Michaux','','2/25/09','electronic','','complete','','','','','2009-02-25 18:01:13','McCoig5239'),(574,'Administration','2009-02-25','mail','DIR','McBane','','RE - PTCOG $27,500.','to McBane','','2-25-09','electronic','','complete','','','','','2009-02-25 19:10:37','McCoig5239'),(575,'Administration','2009-02-25','mail','DIR','Strong','','Travel authorization for staff - construct firelines at CRMO & SOMO, 3/2-6/09, $567.','to BP&A','','2-25-09','','','complete','','','','','2009-02-25 20:40:27','McCoig5239'),(576,'Operations','2009-02-26','email','CHOP','Angelia','SODI DISU','Justificatin for Acquisition: Big McQueen Property @ LURI','Mike -\r\n\r\nAttached please find a E-Memorandum from Superintendent Neill Lee reference\r\na justification for acquisition of the Big McQueen Tract adjacent to the Princess Ann\r\narea of Lumber River State Park.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2008 LURI Supt.

Larry Hyde has advised they are receiving regular phone calls inquiring when the access will be open. On weekends, they are seeing a number of cars parking on the road shoulders around the access entrance, including in front of residents homes.  These people are apparently walking into the park to use the trail and bouldering area. Larry is concerned this activity will erode the good will of the of the neighbors to this new facility. We do not want a repeat of the WIUM parking situation. Below is a message from CCC President Anthony Love concerning the opening of the Boulders Access which I have responded to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith two ranger vacancies, staffing the new facility will be difficult and minimal. But the current situation is also requiring staff time to address the public using the closed facility. The facility is ready to open and doing so prior to a formal dedication will allow the park staff to address the inevitable issues that arise in all new construction / operations. PASU Hyde and I recommend the formal dedication occur in late spring or early summer so as to allow the landscaping to take hold to improve the appearance of the facility. Currently there is minimal or no grass on the road shoulders, cut banks and around the contact station & restroom building.  The current lack of landscaping will not be an issue to the hikers & climbers desiring to access the facility now.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegarding the SC display panel photo, Larry has spoken with his SC counterpart concerning retaking the photograph. Larry was advised SC parks preferred their PIO take the photograph. I will check to see if Larry has been notified concerning the date this will take place.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom CCC president Anthony Love on 2/24/09:\r\n\r\n2) We were under the impression that new Boulders area on Dixon School Road was on a defined time frame to open. We had an excellent experience working with Larry and his staff to provide a new informational kiosk for the area. Shortly after the installation, we heard the most recent news regarding the budgetary situation. Since then, there has been no word on when the facility or area would be opened. Is there any renewed news regarding this? The Charlotte area climbers have been upset by the lack of information regarding the continued closure of a site that for all intensive purposes looks finished and ready for an opening. Is there any information you would like us to provide to help them understand OR is there anything else we could do to help?','2/27/09 UPDATE email from Tom J. see link','','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/FW  Opening Of CRMO Boulders Access Facility.eml.html,file_upload/FW  Opening Of CRMO Boulders Access Facility.eml.html','','2009-04-07 11:38:46','Williams5894'),(578,'Operations','2009-02-26','','CHOP','JONE & SILA','','Joint PAC NOMINATION - JONE & SILA','Shane & James -\r\n\r\nYour request to establish a Joint Park Advisory Committee for JONE & SILA has been Denied.\r\n\r\nPer Staff Directive 92-2: State Park Advisory Committee Operating Procedures:\r\nPage 3. \"The advisory committee must maintain a clear-cut division of responsibilities between itself, its parent agency, and the professional staff . . . \"\r\n\r\nGiven that you each manage separate parks with unique operational concerns, a Joint PAC may not adequately address all necessary functions as\r\nlisted on page 2 of the Directive.

State parks will take advantage of a change in Daylight Savings Time by extending their operating hours in the spring and fall, according to the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\nBeginning March 1, state parks and state recreation areas routinely will close no earlier than 8 p.m. during March, April, May and October. In past years, most state parks closed at 7 p.m. during those months.\r\n\r\nThe changeover to Daylight Savings Time will occur March 9 this year rather than the first weekend in April as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The U.S. Congress is to determine later whether to continue this extension of Daylights Savings Time after reviewing its impacts.\r\n\r\nThe closing time at most state parks during June, July, August and September is 9 p.m. although some areas and facilities close earlier, particularly swimming areas and visitor centers. State parks open at 8 a.m.\r\n\r\n?It?s always a good idea for visitors to take note of posted closing times as they enter a state park and adjust their schedules accordingly,? said Greg Schneider, chief of operations for the parks system. ?This is particularly important for campers since our policy is to close and lock gates to parks and campgrounds at closing time.?\r\n\r\nAll state parks are open year round, normally closing only on Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nA complete schedule of operating hours for all state parks and facilities is available on the parks system?s Web site, www.ncparks.gov.\r\n\r\n# # #\r\n   \r\n  \r\n','','','','complete','','','file_upload/aMarch Closing Time  Daylight Savings Time.txt,file_upload/bFwd March Closing Time  Daylight Savings Time.txt,file_upload/ML March Closing Time.txt,file_upload/cMarch Closing Time Will Be 8 P.M..txt,file_upload/dst_parkhours208.doc','','2009-02-27 17:16:55','Williams5894'),(583,'Operations','2009-02-27','email','CHOP','Angelia Allcox','SODI','  NOTICE of Audit Tuesday March 3: FOFI Audit of Gate Access Fee Controllers Office','From:                              Angelia Allcox [angelia.allcox@ncmail.net]\r\n\r\nSent:                               Thursday, February 26, 2009 12:10 PM\r\n\r\nTo:                                   Tammy Dodd; Jeffrey Owen\r\n\r\nCc:                                   Mike Lambert; denise.williams@ncmail.net; Tony Bass\r\n\r\nSubject:                          NOTICE: FOFI Audit of Gate Access Fee\r\n\r\nAttachments:                 audit (894 KB)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTammy -\r\n\r\nFYI - Fort Fisher has received Notice of Audit from the Controllers Office\r\nfor a Site Visit for next Tuesday, March 3rd or Wednesday, March 4th.\r\n\r\nAudit reference the FOFI Gate Access Fee. \r\n\r\nSee attached PDF Document for details.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAngelia','','','electronic','','complete','','','','','2009-03-05 13:32:03','Williams5894'),(584,'Operations','2009-02-27','email','OPS','Tony Bass','ARCH','operating_expense_budget_line_item_deficits_20090225','CHOP/DISU\'s,\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you know, each Park can easily transfer monies between Line Items in their Operating Expenses Budget (Step by Step Instructions in Budget Forum# 64)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease have all Parks in your District to cover Line Item Negatives at their Park.

Those are the KELA and LURI Ranger positions.  I spoke with Mosella this morning and she has already sent back the previously disapproved appropriated positions to DENR Budget for approval.  This list includes the CHRO ranger position along with ranger positions from PETT and JORD.  She has the priority list and will be cross referencing it based on appropriated positions that are already far along in the hiring process.  There has not been a clear line of communication to DPR from the DENR Budget/ Agency regarding approvals versus disapproval\'s and what the criteria is for either.  But for now positions are being approved based on budget rather than needs.  \r\nWith that being said, this process changes daily based on the budget situation and any additional information coming from the Governor\'s Office.  Operating Reserve positions are at the bottom of the list.  I do know that the CACR Superintendent position is still in DENR classification and it will still be some time before it has been budgeted and goes through the Beacon process.

(it states climbing area will be within 150 miles of Ft. Bragg and references PIMO and CRMO because the guides they contacted recommended PIMO and CRMO as suitable) \r\n\r\nI spoke to Mrs. Hadley about this for a while. This is what I was told. \r\n\r\n-This is part of a mandated program to combat adrenal addiction for post combat vets from Irag and Afghanistan. \r\nThe government is required to put them into adventure training within 90 days of arriving home. \r\n-They want to do this March-September 25-50 soldiers. I told her my concerns about the group size affecting my respective park. I didn\'t speak to our regulations or lack of regulations regarding commercial climbing or needing a SPAC. She said that they will adjust the contract to meet our conditions and regulations. There is language in the attached contract to speak to this. \r\n-Activity would be during the week \r\n-this is a \"performance based request\" which means they have gone to the adventure guides to solicit information on developing the contract, not us.  I told her my concerns that the affected facility/agency (PIMO/NC DPR) was not contacted to help guide the contract. She again reiterated that they want to comply with our policy/regulations. Some of the vendors evidently expressed concern to her that this would not be feasible in a state park. It is also in the contract that the vendor is required to contact us (PIMO) to help develop their proposal. \r\n-the RFP is attached. Bids are due in March 10th. \r\n-We had another call from Ft. bragg yesterday evidently while I was at the river section from someone stating they want to come up memorial day weekend and climb with a large group and guide, and that they have a contract set up with a guide. He was calling to let us know they would be here. Different contract maybe? I\'m sure there have been plenty of smaller scale contracts set up with guide services here in the past. \r\n\r\n\r\n-They are looking to us for guidance at least.  I told her I would get back in touch with her after I read over the contract (unless you direct otherwise) \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nSubject: \r\nROCK CLIMBING FOR FT BRAGG\r\nFrom: \r\n\"Gladkowski-medley, Anthea L CIV USA IMCOM\" <a.gladkowskimedley@us.army.mil>\r\n\r\nDate: \r\nThu, 19 Feb 2009 11:29:32 -0600\r\nTo: \r\n<matt.windsor@ncmail.net>\r\n\r\nTo: \r\n<matt.windsor@ncmail.net>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt,\r\n\r\nHere is the Request for Proposal we discussed.

Attached is the secretary\'s message to division directors on this matter. As stated in the memo, DENR was directed to find an additional $5 million in reversions. Department leadership met to determine the amount each division would be required to cut.  Since DPR is among the larger divisions, we will have to reduce an additional $1.25 million.  This will bring our total amount of reversions to $3.55 million.  We only have four months left in the fiscal year.  Therefore, the most recent reductions will have a significant impact. We have also been told the department has received a greatly reduced quarterly allotment from the Office of State Budget so expenditures outside of the reversions also need to be curtailed.  For these reasons, I am providing the following direction:\r\n\r\n          o Expenditures will only be approved for emergencies or items absolutely essential for fulfilling the division\'s core mission;\r\n          o No travel and training that result in travel costs, unless it is needed to maintain required certifications or the activities are essential in meeting the agency\'s core mission.  Employ conference calls or use other electronic media wherever possible to minimize costs.\r\n          o All equipment purchases going through the purchase and service process and requests for exemption will require full and specific justification and must be approved by the director\'s office. (CI PARTF money not included)\r\n          o All requests for release of positions for hiring must include more than \"boiler plate\" descriptions.  They must include specific park/facility/visitor impacts and consequences at your operation.\r\n          o Normal seasonal hiring is to be suspended.  Requests for advertising, posting and filling seasonal must be approved by district superintendents.  In requesting approval for filling seasonal positions, provide specific information on why this position is essential and impacts to operations/facility/visitor/safety/revenue if it is not filled. \r\n          o Purchase only enough essential supplies to make it through the end of the fiscal year (June 30).\r\n\r\nPlease review any questions with your supervisors.  I know these are challenging times for all involved.  My basic message would be if you can possibly live without the purchase, do so.  I trust each of you understand the seriousness of the situation and appreciate your assistance in helping the division meet these reduction amounts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLewis','n/a','','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/2008-09 Budget .htm,file_upload/Buget Mgt Memo from Secretary -2-09.doc','','2009-05-06 16:29:13','Williams5894'),(598,'Operations','2009-03-09','','DISU\'s SODI-NODI','Mike Lambert','OPS','Littering email from High School Student E.Fisher','From: shark7 [mailto:shark7@nc.rr.com] \r\nSent: Saturday, March 07, 2009 10:59 PM\r\nTo: parkinfo@ncmail.net\r\nSubject: Littering\r\n\r\n    My name is Erik Fisher and I am a student at Raleigh Charter High School.

We will need to cut $355,376.00 from all four districts.  This will break down as follows as cuts at the district level:\r\n\r\nEADI $53,490.\r\nNODI $129,106.\r\nSODI $97,658.\r\nWEDI $75,123.\r\n\r\nThese amounts we determined based on the percentage of the overall total budget that each district spends.  Basically I need you to cut the total amount from your district and let us know how much each park in your district will be cutting to total the amount required for the district.  This reduction is required through the end of the fiscal year.  Budgets for this fiscal year will not include payments for days worked after June 12, 2009.  Keep in mind we will receive additional budget information on the 09-10 budget late next week.  It?s possible that we may need to make deeper cuts for next fiscal year.  It may be best to fill positions as they are needed and align recommendations with start date.  \r\n\r\nIn order to follow the Director?s recent budget recommendation I ask that each seasonal recommendation package include a cover memo providing specific information on why the position is essential to fill.  Also include impacts to operations, facilities, visitor safety and revenue if it is not filled.  Remember that reinstatements and new hires need to be approved through the district office, this is even more important now with budget considerations.  Attached is a spreadsheet to help show the budget cuts for each park.  Return the spreadsheet to Tony and copy Denise and myself by Friday, March 13 at noon. If you have questions about using the spreadsheet contact Tony. \r\n\r\nAll equipment purchases are on hold.  I hope to find out later this week the equipment reductions needed at the district and park level. I will let you know just as soon as I have more information.\r\n\r\nCall me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nMike Lambert\r\nChief of Operations\r\n','Due 3/13/09...NOON','','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/Seasonal Budget Reduction.htm,file_upload/seasonal_payroll_budget_cuts_needed_APPROPRIATED_positions_only (2).xls,file_upload/seasonal_payroll_cuts_needed_appropriated positions only_EAST.xls,file_upload/seasonal_payroll_cuts_needed_appropriated positions only_NORTH.xls,file_upload/seasonal_payroll_cuts_needed_appropriated positions only_SOUTH.xls,file_upload/seasonal_payroll_cuts_needed_appropriated positions only_WEST.xls','','2009-04-07 11:37:39','Williams5894'),(605,'Operations','2009-03-11','','CHOP','Erik Nygard','NODI','PIMO Climbing Management Plan','PILOT MOUNTAIN STATE PARK\r\nROCK CLIMBING MANAGEMENT POLICY\r\nNC STATE PARK POLICY\r\nRock climbing and rappelling will be allowed in the North Carolina state park system\r\nonly in designated areas where the activity will minimally affect the natural resources and\r\ncan be carried out without undue risk to the climber or other visitors.

I am including this memo as part of the approval package for your review.\r\n\r\n1)	Reps Martin House - Plans at the park are to continue to permit Maintenance Mechanic Ken Kenny to live in the structure until he leaves the position.  Department of insurance has indicated it is grandfathered with regards to the occupants living in the residence but any new resident would require extensive upgrades.  \r\n\r\n2)	Inman farm logs: Email has been sent to investigate if logs can be utilized within the division.  I agree this is the best way to use the structure.  However it may be best at this time to offer the structure?s logs to the public or other agencies through surplus. It may be difficult to find adequate storage to preserve the logs for future Division use.\r\n\r\n3)	Yadkin River Residence: This residence has a heat pump as well as an oil furnace.  The oil furnace is on the fixed asset inventory. There is a heat pump that is currently not working.  It?s possible that this unit was replaced by previous park staff but it is at least ten years old.  There is no basement under the structure. This structure has a potential use for someone for materials or to move it.  It is not financially feasible to bring this structure up to living or use standards required of the state.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or require additional information, please contact me. \r\n\r\nMDL/vdw\r\n\r\nAttachments	\r\n\r\ncc:	Erik Nygard, North District Superintendent\r\n	Jerry Howerton, Chief of Maintenance	\r\n','N/A','','','','complete','','','file_upload/REPs-Martin House-Yadkin river Section_Southside PIMO State Park.doc','','2009-04-24 14:44:54','Williams5894'),(670,'NODI','2009-04-24','mail','DISU','Scott Kershner','FALA','B.W.

For the safety of park visitors, the ramp has been closed until we can make the needed adjustments.  Park staff has also posted signs to make sure that visitors are aware of the closure prior to journeying to the end of the boardwalk.  The functionality of this ramp is dependent on the re-nourishment of the beach front around the sun shelter and bathhouse.  Due to federal funding issues and contractual issues outside of our control, this area did not get the normal sand re-nourishment this year.  This has left us extremely susceptible to lunar tides and adverse wind and surf erosion.  This high erosion zone makes it hard to determine whether the sand is going to erode or accrete from one day to the next.  We are in contact with CAMA to determine what, if anything, can be done to remedy this situation in the short term and we hope to have the beach re-nourished during the off-season.  We realize this is a critical crossing for many of our mobility challenged visitors and we hope to get it repaired as soon as possible.  In the interim, we have the all-terrain beach wheel chairs available and will be assisting visitors as necessary in accessing the beach.  Once again, Thank you for your inquiry and feel free to contact us anytime you have a concern or comment about the services provided by state parks.\r\nSincerely,\r\nAdrian \r\n\r\nAdrian O\'Neal\r\nEast District Superintendent\r\nNorth Carolina State Parks and Recreation\r\n345-B Park Entrance Road\r\nSeven Springs, NC  28578\r\nPhone: 919-778-9488\r\nFax:  919-778-9589\r\n\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/FW Fort Macon ramp issue 4-27-09 .htm','','2009-06-11 17:53:36','Williams5894'),(606,'Operations','2009-03-11','','CHOP','Mike','OPS','Response Letter to Mr. Owen for Director/Div Forest Service','Lew, here is some information from Mike in response to Mr. Owen DFR.  (attached ms doc)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMr. Owen,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI believe that there will be instances where State Park Staff can assist the Division of Forest Service (DFR) in fighting fires in western North Carolina.  We want to help out where possible in filling the gap left by the lack of funding to hire seasonal fire fighters.  Our parks are public-use facilities and the budget reductions have left us with fewer seasonal staff available this year, forcing us to reduce services we provide to our visitors. Therefore, we need to evaluate staffing conditions when working to provide you with the requested assistance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll requests for assistance should be coordinated through the division?s Chief of Operations and either of the four district offices.  Contacting individual state park offices is not the most efficient way to obtain the staffing needs you request.  There are many instances in which there are only enough staff to cover the law enforcement, search and rescue, maintenance, resource management and visitor needs at a particular park unit.  A number of the park positions that would normally be available to assist are vacant and frozen.  We will require staff to remain on site to manage and operate the individual park units.   It may be better if you relied on state park crews when readiness plans are designated in the critical to extreme conditions range.  Readiness plans 6 and 7.  During these instances, we could identify individual park staff to be on stand-by to assist with the initial attack throughout the region.  It?s possible that the crew would need to be made up of staff from multiple park units.  Travel and meals for those staff would be a budget expense for the individual parks affected.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation (DPR) manages a five-person prescribed fire crew which may be able to assist with fire control if the need arises.  This crew operates out of the Raleigh area and could travel to the areas where they are needed for fire control.  This crew is available through June of 2009.  Funding for this crew is from a federal, performance -based grant that pays DPR a set amount for each prescription acre burned.  If the crew is not meeting their prescribed burning targets, we have no funds to pay them.  Would DFR be able to fund wages and travel costs for this crew to work outside of state parks system lands?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if either of these options will be suitable to your needs.

At this time, the North Carolina State Park system is not authorized to offer a reduced fee or discount.  The Golden Passport is not accepted at our facilities.   All of our state parks are accessible and available free of charge.  There is a moderate fee for camping and reserving facilities.  Most facilities are available on a first come first serve basis.  However, our State Recreation Areas do charge an entrance fee during the Summer months.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in and discussions on the matter.  During this session of the North Carolina General Assembly, Sen. Jean Preston has sponsored Senate Bill 264, which would exempt disabled veterans from paying access fees at North Carolina state parks, state lakes, state forests and any other areas administered by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The bill has been filed and referred to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate your interest and hope you will consider visiting one of our State Parks.  Feel free to contact me if you have questions or need additional information.  For general park information and instructions on reserving campsites and facilities go to our division website at www.ncparks.gov.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMichael D.

These Cuts have been entered into the ONLINE Fiscal Management System.  Both your District Office & each Park in your District will see New Approved Budget Amounts.\r\n\r\nIn order to see a Detailed Listing of all the Temporary Positions which make up a Park?s Approved Budget, follow these Steps:\r\n\r\nDISTRICT Office access:\r\n\r\n1)	Go to your ?Fiscal Management?  Home Page\r\n2)	From District Menu, Click:  Budgets by Center\r\n3)	Select Budget Group= Payroll Temporary  & Click SUBMIT Button\r\n4)	Click LINK named:  View all Positions for Temporary Payroll\r\n5)	Select any Park  in your District & then click SUBMIT Button\r\n\r\nNotice, the first line on the Report reflects the Total Amount Cut by you for that Park.  Instead of pro-rating your Cut Amounts to each Position at that Park, I decided to show 1 Line with the Total Amount Cut by DISU.  \r\n\r\nNext: Go to column named:  Approved Amount  & scroll to the bottom of this Column.  The Total Approved Amount on this Report represents the Total Approved Seasonal Payroll Budget (Appropriated Positions only) for the Park. \r\n\r\nVERY Important:  The Seasonal Payroll Budget works identical to the Equipment Budget.  This means that it is OK for individual Positions to run a NEGATIVE Balance as long as the Total Posted Balance for ALL Positions stays in the POSITIVE.\r\n\r\nNext:  Go to column named: Posted Payments.  This represents the Total of all Posted Payments (posted means employee was paid) for each Position.  Click on the amount in this column & you will see a Detailed listing of all Payments paid this Fiscal Year, including employee name)\r\n\r\n\r\nPARK Level access to same Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n1)	PARK goes to their ?Fiscal Management?

Obviously, if a park does not have a functioning scanner, the process is dead in the water for that park before it even gets started. The main reason I proposed the method we\'ve adopted is because I knew that the old ARMS program required every park to have a scanner for the same purpose we\'ve implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Even if a park has a working scanner it is IMPERATIVE that their settings produce as small a file size as possible. We are dealing with limited bandwidth for file uploads to the secure server. With (number of files * number of employees * number of parks) the computer will not be processing a small number. Denise and I made the decision to require parks to scan both the W-4 and NC-4 as one file. Also the SS card and Other ID will be scanned as a single file. This reduced the number of files from 7 to 5 without increasing a file\'s size since a single scanned page is the same file size regardless of how much info is on the page. This is because the PDF file is actually an image and not text.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. I suggested to Denise that she request that the District OAs canvass their parks for just the info provided by Julie - good work Julie. I have planned to not grant access for a park to the program until we have confirmation that they have a properly configured scanner. A 3-page PD-107 between 80 and 188 kb is OK. But I wonder why if at least 1 park can produce an 80 kb file why ALL the parks cannot also? If they are able to produce a 3-page 80 kb file, it will mean that all their other scans will be of a small size.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Would it be possible for the IT folks (Carl, Bin, and Rhoda) to take the lead in working with those parks with non-functioning scanners AND ensuring that each park\'s scanner is configured to produce the smallest possible PDF - with a 3-page 80 kb PD-107 file our objective?\r\n\r\n\r\nTom\r\n','','','','see emails dated April 2009','complete','','','','','2009-04-07 14:05:01','Williams5894'),(650,'Operations','2009-04-07','email','CHOP','Mark Janus','','WIUM Harrison parking access Correspondence Mr. Janus','4/7 CHOP response: Mr. Janas,\r\n\r\nI will refer your question to park staff and respond to you as soon as I receive the information.

If you have any transactions that are coded to a 534 account number and the ?total? cost of the transaction is  $500 or more, (whether it be 1 or 100 items that make up that $500 total)  we are required to send a copy of the invoice to the Controller?s Office, even if it does not require and Fixed Asset. \r\n\r\nPlease take the time to review your transactions.  If you have any transactions that pertain to the above information, please scan and email me a copy of the invoice(s).\r\n\r\nAs always, any items that require a Fixed Asset Number will still require the Fixed Asset Input Form and a copy of the invoice.\r\n\r\nAll Fixed Asset procedures can be located at the following website address:  http://www.enr.state.nc.us/ooc/pdf/fixed.pdf .\r\n\r\nFor all that are not aware and not using the updated forms, David Pauley and Rod Bridges of the Controller?s Office, Fixed Asset Section, have taken the time to update all of the Fixed Asset Forms.

This requires the support and coordination of the Park Superintendent to ensure that the review is taking place on a regular basis.  Our website is being hit more often now than ever before due to the CRS link.  It really doesn?t take much time to review the website for accuracy.  Let?s use June 19 as the deadline to review each park?s website.  This should give each Superintendent time to look at the site for content and assign a liaison.  Changes and needs should be sent to Lindy following instructions below.  Thanks in advance. \r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D. Lambert\r\n\r\nFrom: Lindy Allen [mailto:lindy.allen@ncdenr.gov] \r\nSent: Thursday, May 28, 2009 4:18 PM\r\nTo: Mike Lambert\r\nSubject: Web liaison \r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping our Web site up-to-date has always been an enormous challenge, especially from an individual park perspective and with the implementation of the CRS, it is even more important that we ensure all of the information out there is accurate.  In order to accomplish this, I would like to enlist the help of a \"Web liaison\" who will be my main point-of-contact at each park.  \r\n\r\nWhether it is a ranger or an OA, this person would be responsible for sending web updates to me but more importantly, this person would be responsible for reviewing park web page content, at a minimum of every 6 months.  Parks have between 3 to 15 pages and I need the web liaison to be aware of all of the information that is on the web representing their park.  It is also important that this person share the information that is on the web with the PASU and other park staff.\r\n\r\nI don\'t necessarily need to know who the web liaison is, I would just like to be confident that each park\'s web content is being reviewed on a regular basis.  There are some parks that still have \"???\" on the \"Facilities and Fees\" page.  The question marks are not an acceptable answer.  This was merely a placeholder that Ed created while developing the Web site and I have still got some stragglers out there who have not completed this information.  \r\n\r\nDon\'t interpret this as a criticism, it is just a call to action.  As the world becomes increasingly more computer savvy, we need to make sure that we are staying ahead of the curve.  We can\'t afford to have outdated or inaccurate web info representing the division in any way.  Our Web site serves as a gateway for potential park visitors and just as you make sure everything is operating correctly at the park, the same attention needs to be focused on the park\'s web pages.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I would like to see the web liaison duties added to an individual\'s workplan.  This would be the most effective way to be sure that web content is being reviewed and updated as needed.  I keep records of who, when and what requests have been made and I would be happy to discuss any of this info with PASUs for workplan evaluation purposes.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLindy Allen\r\nPublications Coordinator & Webmaster\r\nNC Division of Parks & Recreation\r\n1615 MSC\r\nRaleigh, NC 27699-1615\r\n919.715.8708\r\n\r\n','n/a','','','','complete','','','file_upload/FW Web liaison .htm','','2009-06-11 13:08:12','Williams5894'),(720,'Operations','2009-06-11','email','CHOP','Erik Nygard','NODI for HARI','HARI HAW River Advanced PR 65006900 Posting Documents','Mosella, here is the Haw River Park Ranger 65006900 information.

','District Superintendents,\r\nIf for some reason you have a vacancy in one of your current seasonal positions not listed on the approved request for exemption then begin compiling a list at the district level.  Based on the amount of time and effort it has taken to get this most recent approval, I do not want to individually submit a request for exemption for every seasonal position that comes open.  You at the district level make the determination if the requested position can be considered a high priority that is critical to park operations.  If needed we can combine the list and forward for approval at a later time.  For right now work from the approved list.   Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D. Lambert\r\n\r\n5/29 Tammy and Mosella,\r\nPlease confirm my interpretation.  Parks are working to hire the approved seasonal positions listed on the request for exemption submitted yesterday.  If a vacancy occurs from a position that someone was working in prior to the direction from OSBM.  Then filling that vacancy will require a request for exemption be sent up the chain.  Regardless if someone was in the position prior to the freeze it will still require that a request for exemption be completed before the position can be filled.

It makes no difference if the person is being reinstated per the instructions from the Governor?s Budget Restrictions.

While it may feel isolating, you are in the good company of 40 people, all folks privileged to hold the title of NC State Park Superintendent.  Within this new dynamic situation, lent to us courtesy of the State?s economy, the push to create and implement a central reservation system for our state park visitors and to the relentless demands of daily operations we are figuring out what we can do as a collective. Look around you.  This is the staff that you have to work with during this very active time.  Could you do more with more staff?  Of course you could.  But the measure of our division as a whole can exceed our expectations in this most difficult time.  So we have  fewer staff within each park.  What can we do with what we have?   Address the issues that are most important and task people to cover them.  Place your resources towards the most critical issues.  I am asking you to work at your highest potential.  I do not expect that you do this alone.  You can expect from me to keep you informed as I learn the resources and efforts we may direct to your park.  How do I intend to do this?  I must work smarter and use my allies ? your District Superintendants and our operations staff to communicate with all of you.  In the last 5 years there have been 4 different people working in the capacity of CHOP.  Status quo is difficult to figure out, we don?t have one.  So I need to address some issues so that we may work together in a more productive manner.  Your District Superintendent will hear and disseminate all up to date, issues from DPR to you.  I operate this way so that we may do our work smarter, not harder.  You on the other hand should communicate through our chain of command through the District Superintendents.  You should expect the same from your staff.  If we want to uphold the mission of our division we have to be efficient.  You should herald your cause and it should be important to you.  Present it as such, yet realize that your issue is sorted with 39 other park units and the needs of 400 field staff.  We are looking for collective trends over time.  So at one moment your issue may become the central focus of the entire Division.  Yet realize that there may be other times that what you consider important is not the highest priority for the collective.  So I operate to serve you as the internal customer of the division so that you are able to sustain the Mission of our Division.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

Mrs. Jones advised that she plans on working the next 2 weeks with her last day at State Parks identified as Wednesday - July 1, 2009.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the South District OA provides administrative support for the District Superintendent, District operations staff and (10) District park units; 107 staff total.  This critical position provides a variety of complex support functions including personnel, payroll, budget and accounting functions.\r\n\r\nGiven the current budget climate and hiring restrictions, I am concerned that when this position becomes vacant it may remain frozen for an extended period of time or it may be permanently cut.  I would like to officially request that alternate employment, with amended work hours, be offered to Mrs. Jones to retain her services and protect this position.\r\n  \r\nSODI OA Jamie Jones has advised that she would be interested in pursuing Part-Time, Permanent Employment in her current position working 20 hours a week if given the option.  \r\n\r\nCan you please confirm if I have the flexibility, as her Immediate Supervisor, to amend her work schedule and temporarily revise her Job Description.  This offer would be conditional; within 6 months or less I would ask that she either returns to Full-time, Permanent Employment working 40 hours a week or separates from BEACON Position #60033093 permanently.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request,\r\n\r\nAngelia\r\n','n/a','e-file','','','complete','','','file_upload/SODI_OA_J._Jones_Resignation__Request_to_Amend_Work_Schedule_to_20_Hours_a_Week.htm,file_upload/SODI_OA_J._Jones_(60033093)_Resignation._6.17.09.doc','','2009-06-19 18:40:57','Williams5894'),(741,'Administration','2009-06-19','','DIR','Jeffreys','','Road maintenance agreement report - DOT and DPR.','','','','','','complete','','','','','2011-12-19 20:40:47','Eikinas5239'),(742,'Operations','2009-06-22','','DIR','Mike','CHOP',' Request to Assist Kings Mtn.

I had recently asked Pam if she would contact you and ask if you would be willing to fund a printing of the Steward.  A few years ago NCNR helped out with the printing cost and was able to include an article about their organization and efforts along the New River.  I wanted to give you the same opportunity to highlight some of NRCP?s accomplishments and to help us out with funding.  As you know our State and Division are facing severe budget restrictions and printing the Steward is not a high priority in the state budget office when it comes to the pressing issues that the state is facing.  We are continuing to seek other funding sources to continue the publication of the newsletter.   I am copying Charlie Peek who is our Division Public Information Officer.  He will be able to guide you through the process.  I?ve included a link to the Steward that should provide you an example of previous articles.  Give my best to Melanie and the Kids.

Personally I think it is an unproductive bureaucratic policy and is not at all camper friendly.\r\n \r\nFirst, the new policy makes it impractical for us to do those spur-of-the moment camping outings at Jordan Lake.  We have always found that there are many unresevered sites available for us to select upon arrival.  This new policy will insure that those unreserved sites will not be used.  That will most likely reduce revenues for the Park Service in the long run.\r\n \r\nSecond, it is very difficult to select a site from a site map and be assured that the site is satisfactory for our needs and tastes.  When we are allowed to select an available site based on inspection, we can be reasonably assured that our visit will be an enjoyable one.\r\n \r\nThird, the new reservation system will add a three dollar per day additional cost to our camping expenses.  For a five day outing, that is fifteen more dollars.  This additional cost does not result in any additional value for the patron.  And for retirees on fixed income, it is just another cost burden.\r\n \r\nFinally, the new reservation system will simply mean that we will have to go to one of the South Carolina State Parks for our camping outings.  The SC parks still have a patron friendly system in place.\r\n \r\n                        Sincerely,\r\n \r\n                         Robert P. Armstrong\r\n                         Bladenboro, NC\r\n','Mr. Armstrong,\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing your concerns about North Carolina\'s state parks reservation system. The N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation is committed to service and strives to be responsive and receptive to all comments, concerns and inquiries from our visitors and the general public.  If, in the past, you have received less than satisfactory service from our agency, I want to know about it.\r\n\r\nCampsites at the Crosswinds Campground will be included in the central reservation system and can be reserved 48 hours in advance through the call center or internet site.  Reservations for campsites and facilities can be made upon your arrival date if the campsite is vacant.  Reservation terminals will be available at the Crosswinds fee station and at the park office.  Once you arrive and determine that the campsite is available then you will have the ability to reserve and pay for the site.  All campsites in the Parker?s Creek section will remain available on a first come, first serve basis.  \r\n\r\nPark Staff are currently working to add campground maps for all campsites at Jordan Lake.  This will be very helpful in choosing a particular campsite in a camp loop.  For now each site has a list of attributes which includes useful information about the site, including site dimensions, shade or full sun, and water availability on or near the site.   \r\n\r\nThe $3 surcharge is used to support the central reservation system.  Infospherix a Clarksburg, Maryland company operates the call center and internet site. We feel that one of the most important features of the new system is the call-in center, operated from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday to assist people who do not have access to the Internet or who find navigating the Web site problematic. The call center can be reached by calling toll-free at 1-877-7CAMPNC.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to providing outstanding customer service was the driving force behind the development of the centralized reservation system. Up until this point, people visiting our parks traveled, in many cases great distances, without a guarantee that a site would be available for their use.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will continue to visit Jordan lake State Recreation Area in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael D.

Lambert, Chief of Operations\r\nSUBJECT:	Stone Mountain State Park Equestrian Liability \r\n\r\nWe are interested in your opinion about matters related to equestrian use within Stone Mountain State Park (STMO).\r\nBackground Information\r\nWithin STMO, we provide a 4.9 mile equestrian trail that was poorly designed to traverse steep slopes, shallow soils, and granite rock outcroppings.  The trail was originally a woods road that was converted into a trail.  A map of the equestrian trail is attached for your review. \r\nPark staff has recommended closure of this trail for visitor safety and concerns for damage to the natural resource.  Two Division Safety Officers have recommended the closure of this trail because of the potential for user slips and falls while riding this trail.  The Division?s Natural Resource Management staff has also recommended closure of this trail due to erosion and damage that is occurring to the natural resource.  The Division?s Trails Program staff has recommended closing this trail due to visitor safety and natural resource concerns.  All staff listed above has attempted to find a more sustainable routing for this trail but these attempts have failed.  The division has hired professional engineers to evaluate the repairs needed to bring the existing trail up to division standards.  These professional engineers have estimated the costs of renovations would cost approximately 1.5 million dollars and require continual maintenance due to the excessive slope of the trail surface. see attachment\r\n','na','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Draft_E-Memo-STMO_Equestrian_Trail_Legal_Opinion_7-6-09.doc','','2009-07-09 15:01:57','Williams5894'),(773,'Operations','2009-07-09','','Mike','Tammy Dodd','Accounting/Budget','Operating Procedures for FY2009-10','Even though we do not need to do an RE unless a park has a purchase of $10,000 or more which will come into effect when we begin to do equipment purchases or possible any new contracts, I want to continue doing the internal weekly approval to purchase process.  We will have to hold back 15% of budget for FY0910 from the get go (we can determine where we will hold the funds back when the budget drops).  Having the parks think about what their needs are week to week I believe can stop some unnecessary spending.  We will have a lot of new parks going full on line and the cost of utilities will be going up and we will need to ensure our budgets cover the absolute necessities first.  Also, I fear the RE process could be reinstated at anytime if the budget worsens.  The weekly approval process helps DPR management to see how the parks intend on spending funds and we can report to DENR that we have a system in place which helps us to make sound purchases but meet our reversion budget of 15% at the same time.  \r\n\r\nI have spoken to Don before he left and he is in agreement with me.  Let me know your thoughts.

We appreciate the effort you put into this proposal, and we are happy to more fully explain the factors we are considering and the steps we are taking to respond to your proposal.\r\n\r\nAs your letter points out, it can be challenging to balance recreational access with protection of the park?s natural resources and efficient use of taxpayer dollars for park operation.  For any proposed facility, including trails, we assess the quality of natural communities that would be affected, the potential susceptibility of the communities to recreational impacts, and the potential impacts on rare species.  Determination of the quality of a given natural community includes consideration of its maturity, the level of previous disturbance, the relative rarity of the community type, and the presence of any NC Natural Heritage Program element occurrence, significant natural heritage area, or dedicated nature preserve.  Determination of the susceptibility of the natural community to recreational impacts may include consideration of hydrology, soil and vegetation types, as well as the type of recreational activity proposed.  Potential impacts to rare species are determined based on their individual habitat requirements, life histories, behaviors, and rarity status, and how these factors relate to the specific activity or facility proposed.\r\n\r\nFrom a design perspective, we consider proximity to and compatibility with other facilities and activities, appropriate topography and soil types, user demand, infrastructure needs for roads, parking and utilities, and potential costs.  Facilities and activities may need to be clustered or separated, topography or other physical features may pose design constraints, and the potential cost should be proportionate to the anticipated level of use.\r\n\r\nFrom an operational perspective, we evaluate the staff time needed to open, close, patrol and provide visitor services for a given facility or activity.  We look at potential safety and law enforcement issues, as well as future maintenance obligations.\r\n\r\nAt the Robeson Creek site, our biologists found high quality examples of Upland Depression Swamp Forest.  It is the only known example of its kind in the Jordan Lake area, it is often wet, and it is important as an amphibian breeding area.  Xeric Hardpan Forest and Dry-Oak Hickory Forest communities at the site are also mature, high quality, and sensitive.  At the same time, the Robeson Creek site is remote from our other operations and would be difficult to open, close, and patrol.  While the average cyclist would stay on the trails and respect wet weather closures, there are always individuals who require some level of enforcement to protect sensitive natural resources.  It may be possible to construct a trail that would avoid the sensitive areas, but that would substantially reduce the trail miles available, further reducing the recreational benefit to be gained from a fairly significant investment in staff cost.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Robeson Creek site is not preferable, we agree with your letter regarding the benefits of healthful outdoor recreation and the positive aspects of encouraging children and young people to enjoy the outdoors.  We are now assessing other sites at Jordan Lake to determine if there is another, more suitable location where mountain biking trails could be provided.  We will contact you again soon, once we have identified a promising site.  We would like to select a feasible location before we ask your volunteers to invest their time developing a proposed trail design.  \r\n\r\nThank you again for your effort and support.  We look forward to working with you.\r\n\r\n','mailed cc:  Angelia, Shederick, Carol, Darrel, Sauret included in Swanson envelope','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Cliff_Swanson_Off_Road_Cyclist-JORD_7-14-09.pdf,file_upload/JORD-Cliff_Swanson_letter_7-13-09.doc','','2009-07-14 11:43:45','Williams5894'),(776,'Operations','2009-07-14','email','Adrienne McCoig','Mike Lambert','OPS','MOTOR FLEET MANAGEMENT EXCEL AND E-MEMORANDUM TO DIRECTOR','Adrienne, Mike placed a copy of his E-Memorandum and Motor Fleet vehicle plan for DPR MFM from T.

Trust and transparency serve as the foundation for DENR\'s core values. How can we as state employees best ensure that we act in an ethical manner in the course of our daily work?\r\n\r\nDr. Jim Brunet, Professor at NCSU Department of Public Administration, will present tools, philosophies, and approaches to consider before we make our decisions. Dr. Brunet will also facilitate a discussion on our real world ethical dilemmas.\r\n\r\nWe hope to answer and discuss the many shades of gray we encounter in our state work.\r\n\r\nPlease register at the Managers Forum website:\r\nhttp://www.enr.state.nc.us/managerforum/Pages/registration.html\r\n\r\nAn informational flier about the event is attached.

As I mentioned in the conference call today I would like for you to use these as a reference only.  Appropriated and OR funds are combined into one budget.  Remember to request the equipment and operating budgets that you need in the district.  It is very possible that we may need to reduce the request based on the approved budget.  Tony will be removing the choice between OR and Appropriated funding on the databases.  Remember to view your needs as a collective of the Division?s needs. \r\n\r\nYou can also ask that your parks begin requesting their operating budgets.  Include your requests for new facilities coming on-line this year.  Let?s try to have all budget requests approved at the district level by September 15th as well.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  \r\n\r\nMichael D.

The purpose of this right of entry is to investigate, locate, analyze, and remove harmful or hazardous ordnance, munitions, and/or fragments of munitions contaminates that may be present on Bear Island.   A representative from Hammocks Beach State Park has met with members from MC Base Camp Lejeune and met with the contracting firm of CH2 Hill on July 1, 2009 for the purpose of the investigation process.  Based on the meetings that were attended by our field staff and conversations that took place with our Division Resource Management Staff the Division of Parks and Recreation has agreed to a right of entry for the initial investigative portion of the project based on the following exceptions:\r\n\r\n1.	It is agreed that the MC Base Camp Lejeune or their contractors will not initiate the aerial magnetometer survey until after September 1, 2009 as requested by the park due to colonial waterbirds nesting on the east and west end of Bear Island.  \r\n\r\n2.	 The Base will also initiate a \"Notice to Mariners\" before the aerial survey begins and the Base will provide assistance to control boat traffic/access to the affected portion of Bear Island with park restricting foot traffic on the ocean side of the island.\r\n\r\n3.	 As part of the initial investigation the MC Base Camp Lejeune and their contractors will be allowed to utilize their own ATV vehicle if needed and operate said vehicle on the ocean front and ends of the island where park vehicles are currently operated.  Vehicle traffic is restricted on the interior portion of the island due to uneven terrain and sensitive vegetation.\r\n\r\n4.	A pull behind or push type magnetometer may be used along the ocean front and the sandy flat on the east end of Bear Island after September 1, 2009 and hand held or hand carried magnetometer may be used on the interior portion of the island after this date.  \r\n\r\n5.	MC Base Camp Lejeune and their contractor may conduct soil and water samples at various locations on Bear Island as needed for the completion of this project and all auger holes should be filled in after the completion of each test. \r\n\r\n6.	Upon the completion of the initial investigation a plan of action will be developed by MC Base Camp Lejeune and discussed with N.C. State Park  personnel to relay the findings of the initial investigation, discuss the plan of action and to gain approval to implement the plan of action.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration in this matter and if you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.\r\n','n/a','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Right_of_Entry_Memo_For_Bear_Island_7-2-09.doc','','2009-09-08 11:45:17','Williams5894'),(862,'OPAA','2009-09-04','','Tom Howard','DENISE','','Permanent HR Database Tracking Project-form upload, etc','Below is the list of screeners for the approved positions that are getting ready to post.

With the minimal commissioned staffing at the park, we are dependent upon the LLPD for public safety assistance. And with no staff residences within the park, we are also dependent upon LLPD for after-hours first responder assistance. The 2007 late-night suicide at Chimney Rock Park is an example of LLPD voluntarily assisting the division. Chief Hester has been very supportive of the park and appreciative when park staff has assisted his officers. At the same time, Chief Hester and Superintendent Wallace recognize the need for mutual assistance to occur within the framework of the applicable general statutes to reduce agency and individual officer liability.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear understanding between Superintendent Wallace and Chief Hester that interagency assistance would only be offered when it is feasible to do so and for limited amounts of time.  Agency responses would be documented on the mutual aid formal request form in the attached list.  Division responses would be administratively managed allowing assistance only for specific requests. The agency with primary jurisdiction will be responsible for the management of incidents. The role of the assisting agency will be to provide initial first responder assistance only. As per the general statutes, the division director?s signature is required on the mutual assistance agreement.\r\n\r\nWhile frequently discussed, mutual assistance agreements are new to our division. I realize there will be a need for additional information and a probable legal review. Please feel free to contact me if you need additional information.\r\n\r\nMDL/vdw\r\n\r\nAttachment	\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/CHRO-LLPD_Mutual_Assistance_Agreement_Memo_7-22-09.docx,file_upload/CHRO-LLPD_Mutual_Assistance_Agreement_Memo_from_Tom_Jackson.doc','','2009-09-11 15:18:59','Williams5894'),(867,'Operations','2009-09-03','','Mike','Adrian O\'Neal','','HABE Confidential Personnel Incident-Bleck','n/a','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/HABE-Confidential_incident_9-3-09.pdf,file_upload/Bleck_copy.jpg,file_upload/Fulcher.jpg','','2009-09-11 15:47:48','Williams5894'),(868,'Administration','2009-09-03','','DIR','Reuter','','2008 CWMTF Agreements','9/8/09 to Reuter & Regier','Don & Sue, They\'re signed but can you explain the impacts (on other land acq proj.) the matches for these have?

Nearly all North Carolina State Parks and Recreation Areas close and lock entrance gates at night.  During June, July and August most parks will close at 9:00 pm and closing hours at other times of the year are basically at twilight.  To take advantage of daylight savings time, state parks recently extended operating hours in the spring and fall, closing at 8:00 pm during March, April, May and October.  Gates are closed to protect visitors, exceptional natural resources and facilities within the parks.  Many of our parks have hazards associated with certain outdoor recreation activities making it imperative that parks are closed and gates locked at twilight to ensure visitor safety.  Some of these include hiking, rock climbing, and kayaking.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate your positive comments regarding the locking of gates in camping areas.  I hope you understand that  our established gate hours and closing times are intended to provide a safe outdoor environment for all of our park users.  Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns.  Feel free to call me should you desire additional information.\r\n\r\nSincerely,       \r\n\r\nMichael D.

Below is the written version.  Distribute as you think appropriate.  Thanks for allowing the opportunity.\r\n\r\nBruce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCap Imp Fund Update:\r\n\r\nAs many of you know  the FY 2008-09 DPR Capital Improvement approved funds (revenues) fell short by about $4.4M., resulting in unfunded, or partially funded projects as follows:\r\n\r\n?	Systemwide Trail Maintenance Funds????????????????????????????? 500,000\r\n?	Carver?s Creek, Establish Operations Facilities?????????????????????????500,000\r\n?	Chimney Rock, Rocky Broad Bridge, Trail, & Facility Improvements (unfunded balance)....700,000 \r\n?	Gorges, Phase I-B, VC, Sewer, Picnic Area, Maintenance Compound (unfunded balance)?2,737,212 \r\n\r\nTotal Unfunded Projects FY 2008-09..????????????????????????????????4,436,212\r\n\r\nAt the August 21 meeting the Park Authority approved the Division?s  request  to carry the unfunded projects forward to FY 2009-10.   After meeting the Division?s obligations to repay COPS funds of $7.2M the Capital Improvement Program will be asking the Parks and Recreation Authority at the Oct 30 meeting to allot about  $8.3M to cover last year?s project obligations and to keep your Major Maintenance, Exhibit Maintenance, and Trail Maintenance  Projects moving, while also beginning to address lake (dam) safety issues at CLNE, CACR, and MARI.  \r\n\r\nWhat does this mean to Operations?\r\n\r\n?	Cap Imp PARTF funds are tied directly to the economy and will remain significantly down until/unless the economy returns to previous levels.   \r\n?	You are likely to be seeing less ?new facility? construction projects unless/until the economy returns to previous levels. \r\n?	Older projects having the perception of ?old, idle? money will under close scrutiny by DPR, DENR, OSB, hung-up projects could see reassignment to meet more urgent needs.\r\n?	You are already seeing and will continue to see a significant increase with designer and contractor interest in our projects, regardless of how small they may be.   Competitive bids should result in better bargains and better quality projects  in the parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff Update:\r\n\r\nD & D Staff Update:   \r\nVery thankful that we?ve not had to ask anyone to leave, but the D&D section is short by 3 previously filled positions.\r\n\r\n?	Exhibit Program:\r\nExhibit coordinator?s vacant position was cut.  Cut position vacancy was a result of  promotion of Siobhan Oneal to Program Head. \r\n?	Park Design Program\r\nPark Designer I position Vacancy was created by departure of Stephanie Richardson and  was frozen some time ago.   We have not yet received approval to post that position, but it is the mix for consideration. \r\n\r\nGIS Technician Position is vacant effective Sept 18 due to the departure of  Luis Carrasco.   As we speak, Mosella & DENR HR folks are  working with us to possibly fill this position with a qualified RIF candidate from another agency.  With good luck we can fill a position while enabling a career state government employee an opportunity to return to employment. \r\n\r\nWhat do these vacancies mean to Operations?  \r\n\r\n?	You can expect our  top priority is to move forward with existing legally binding contracts already underway, and you can expect to see some minor shifting or reassignment of project responsibilities within the affected programs  as needed to complete those projects. \r\n?	 You can expect to see decreased opportunities for both the  Exhibit Program and Park Design Program to make  site visits or to allow design time related to non contract questions or issues.  \r\n?	Those who were working directly with Luis  will see an obvious halt in the forward movement of those issues.   Although we maintain high expectations, even if we are fortunate to fill that position, it is unlikely we will land someone who is as highly skilled and trained as himself.  It will take time to bring someone else up to speed in those tasks.  We have quickly learned that in order for the Division to keep up with current advanced technologies \r\n\r\nWhile the funding a staff shortages are ever present in our daily routine, I?m very thankful and pleased to report that we have a current total of  $64,442,409 tied to current Cap Imp Projects, distributed among the four districts and 24 different parks.  When Mike invited me to participate in your meeting I did something I very rarely do?.I ran a report to check how the CI projects are distributed geographically throughout the system?.and found the following:\r\n\r\nEADI:  7 Parks with C I Projects   \r\n\r\nNODI:   5 Parks with C I Projects \r\n\r\nSODI:     5 Parks with C I Projects \r\n\r\nWEDI:   7 Parks with C I projects \r\n\r\nOf course these numbers change  quite frequently as we close projects out and start new one,  but it does show that we have a reasonable and fairly balanced system in place.\r\n\r\nStatewide PEP list:  It is our current goal to present an updated Cap Imp Project list to the Park Authority in October \r\n\r\nQuestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBruce Garner (Please note new email address:  Bruce.Garner@ncdenr.gov\r\n','n/a','9/30','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/Design__Development_Section_Update.htm,file_upload/CI_Project_Status_Report_thru_August_31.pdf','','2009-09-30 15:07:51','Williams5894'),(894,'Operations','2009-09-15','','Albert Urquhart','CHOP','','Renewal of the Crosswinds Marina lease. Jordan Lake Water Sports History @ JORD with Business to be Sold as of 7.14.10  Urquhart','Dear Mr. Urquhart:\r\n\r\nI enjoyed meeting you at your Marina facility on August 28, 2009.  During the conversation, I told you the Division of Parks and Recreation (DPR) staff would be meeting with representatives from the State Property Office and the DENR Division of Purchase and Services to discuss the process for renewal of the Crosswinds Marina lease.\r\n  \r\nThe group met on September 10, to discuss the lease and what steps would be required to move the process along.  It was determined that the upcoming lease termination would necessitate a request for proposal from prospective bidders.  Interested bidders would be required to submit a bid determining the fair market value of the Marina.  The term of the new lease would be for a minimum of 13 years. The termination of the lease would coincide with the DPR and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers lease.\r\n  \r\nAs you know, the Crosswinds Marina lease is set to expire on May 14, 2012.  Our goal is to advertise the lease at least one year prior to the expiration of the current agreement.  Park staff will begin developing the bid specifications over the next few months, working in conjunction with Jordan Lake State Recreation Area staff, the State Property Office, the DENR Division of Purchase and Services, Attorney General?s Office and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.\r\n\r\nOnce again park staff reiterated that they were pleased with your marina operation and the services you provide to the public at Jordan Lake.

In actuality, the article references the federal ?Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD)? that became effective February 2010 which allows the possession of firearms in National Parks (e.g. Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway) and national wildlife refuges provided that the person is not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm.  It also allows a person to possess a concealed handgun in a national park / wildlife refuge if that person holds a valid Concealed Handgun Permit from the state that the national park/wildlife refuge is in (e.g. North Carolina) and is abiding by the rules governing that concealed weapon permit.  This federal law and policy change by the National Park Service is not applicable to North Carolina State Parks. \r\n\r\nThus, our website is accurate in that our North Carolina State Parks? Firearms Rule, which is grounded in North Carolina Administrative Code - NCAC 15A NCAC 12B .0901 and G.S. 113-35, does prohibit the carrying or possession of firearms and other weapons by anyone except authorized park employees, their agents, contractors or officers of the state. This Rule has been in effect and enforced for many years. Technically, this does mean that the general public is not allowed to carry or possess firearms, weapons or explosives, in any North Carolina State Park or managed property. \r\n\r\nThe North Carolina legislature passed G.S. 14-415.23 in 1995 that prescribed a uniform system for the regulation of legally carrying a concealed handgun in North Carolina. Various other statutes regarding concealed handguns passed by the legislature and a variety of interpretations by law enforcement and judicial officials across the country over the past several years has created confusion and uncertainty among the general public and state agencies regarding the possession of concealed weapons on certain state properties. \r\n\r\nTherefore, with the goal of fully abiding by all statutes and regulations, the Division of Parks and Recreation has requested an official opinion from the North Carolina Attorney General?s Office on whether our firearms rule should be enforced on those with valid concealed handgun permits.  We will be pleased to share the Attorney General?s opinion when it is received.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael D.

I believe the public will understand the increase as long as they feel that they are getting something in return.  Clean, well maintained facilities and exemplary customer service.

Please advise staff to begin ordering as soon as possible.  Purchasing notes are listed below and staff should refer to previous purchasing emails from Tammy and Joanne along with purchasing guidelines/instructions in the FIND Database.  Our goal is to have all equipment paid for and purchase orders issued before the Christmas Holiday.   \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in an earlier e-mail, I think it\'s important that each Superintendent delegate portions of the purchasing requirements to their staff.  One or two staff members cannot efficiently purchase equipment in the tight deadlines that we require.  Make sure that we follow the purchasing guidelines and check state term contract for needed items.  Joanne can assist with purchasing some of the larger items.  She has specifications for ATV?s and other items.  Ask staff to work within her specifications for those items that she bulk purchases. \r\n\r\n?	Contact Bryan Dowdy if you have requested radio communications equipment or firearms, mounts and lights.  Reference the approved ER#?s.  Bryan is the purchaser for these items if you have specifications or questions.  Do not order these items unless he instructs you to do so.\r\n\r\n?	Contact Joanne Barbour via email and reference the approved ER#?s for ATVs, electric cars, pumper units, boats and trailers that are not on state contract.   She will assist or direct the parks with the purchase process for these items.  Do not order these items unless instructed to do so by Joanne.\r\n\r\n?	Tammy Dodd & Carl Jeeter are the purchasers for computers, printers, copiers and audio visual equipment.  If you have approved ER#s these items will be purchased in bulk by them.  If you have questions about the approved ER#.  Contact Tammy or Carl.  Do not order these items unless instructed to do so by Tammy or Carl.\r\n\r\n?	Angelia Allcox will be ordering vehicles.  I have spoken to each of you and recommended that we order smaller more fuel efficient vehicles when possible.  Some of you have made changes to the equipment request to reflect this suggestion.  I have included comments on the database to recommend ordering smaller vehicles.  Please review and work with Angelia on your order.  Angelia, I would like to review the complete order with the Director before purchasing.\r\n\r\nPurchasing instructions are listed on the FIND database and have been sent periodically by Tammy or Joanne.  Please refer to these instructions.  I have also included some additional information to this e-mail.\r\n\r\nUpdate the budget database weekly as to what items have been ordered, received, and paid.  This is very important due to the dynamic nature of our budget this year.  Budget staff will be checking the status of this requirement on a regular basis.  Please do the same with your district staff so we continually have updated information.   \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

There are only a few more issues to handle but as of right now,  we have no separations greater than 30 days old (that we are aware of), an org unit for CHRO (pending Best Shared Services) is to be established and a few position transfers.  \r\n\r\nDenise, you and I discussed the color code to check on some positions, but hopefully this helps to cross-check any changes made.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.  thanks, Teresa\r\n\r\nHuman Resources Generalist\r\nDivision of Parks & Recreation\r\n(919) 715-8712 office phone\r\n(919) 715-3085 fax\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/AftersepDeccemberPTElist.xlsx','','2017-08-02 17:56:22','Williams5894'),(1007,'Operations','2009-12-15','','Flying Fox Adventures','Mike','','Flying Fox Adventures Response','Alex,\r\nOur Division has concessionaires that operate certain facilities within our parks.

Fields that require completion on both have been highlighted in the documents.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are the park should only have to fill in the e-memo, forward to you and Adrienne complete the letter for Lewis, attach the card and send to the volunteer with a cc of the letter to the issuing park.\r\n\r\nA few questions have come up along the way:\r\n\r\nAdded the field in the letter that this card has a maximum retail value of $XXX.  Need to determine max. value for 7 days and 14 days camping-  (full service or bare bones?).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe back of the card does not state whether the gift cards can be used to purchase merchandise or to reserve facilities like picnic shelters.  In the original volunteer guidelines, the Certificate of Appreciation could only be used for park entrance or for camping reservations.  With the new system, will the user be able to purchase/reserve anything with the funds on the card?\r\n\r\nWe?re assuming the gift cards can be used through the call center, as the backs of the cards list the telephone number.  If this is not the case, will the volunteers need to bring their original letter to the park along with the gift card when they make a reservation?  Kershner indicate they should not have to bring the letter along to keep it simple.  I believe it is useful as a courtesy for the staff.\r\n\r\nThe old letter indicated free use of bathhouses for up to 4 people per day.  Removed the ability to use card at bathhouses for up to four people.  This will not be possible to implement as bathhouses do not have POS terminals.\r\n\r\nShould the cc: go to the park superintendent?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\nErik Nygard, District Superintendent\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Gift_Card_E-Memo.docx,file_upload/Gift_Card_Sample_Letter.doc','','2009-12-28 12:41:04','Williams5894'),(2494,'OPAA','2012-06-15','','','DENISE WILLIAMS','','RVP REQUEST FORMS AND DOCUMENTS FOR JULY 1,2012-DECEMBER 31,2012','From: Williams, Denise \r\nSent: Thursday, June 14, 2012 2:58 PM\r\nTo: McNair, Rosilyn M\r\nCc: Tingley, Carol; Lambert, Mike; Reuter, Don; Dodd, Tammy\r\nSubject: RVP for 7/1/2012-12/31/2012 \r\n\r\nRosilyn, Carol Tingley signed the signature page of the prepared RVP 7/1/2012-12/31/2012.

If we stay with this plan, these positions would have to sit vacant for the whole year.  \r\n\r\nWe can now begin to look at this closer and come up with substitutions.  The positions only have to sit vacant long enough to create the mandatory $500,000 dollars needed which includes the fringes.  They can be a combination of regular and law enforcement positions.  \r\n\r\nWe also have to keep in mind that I have estimated that we need around $500,000 in lapse salaries to be able to cover some of our other salary lines such as holiday pay, shift premium, workers comp issues and law enforcement special separation cost.  \r\n\r\nI have updated the spread sheet Mosella provided to show the positions which are currently part of the mandatory $500,000 reversion, and I have included the new positions that hopefully can get budgeted soon and become part of our lapse salaries.   We can look at this list to make a determination as to what we really want to be part of the mandatory $500,000 and the estimated $500,000 that we will need to operate.   \r\n\r\nSalaries/fringes  are prorated according to when vacated and when established so we need to keep this in mind when coming up with dollar amounts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTammy\r\n\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Copy_of_Vacancy_DPR_Report_10_02_09.xls','','2017-08-02 17:55:52','Williams5894'),(1053,'Operations','2009-12-17','','CHOP','Tom Jackson','','PAC IDEAS','From: Jackson, Tom \r\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2009 9:33 AM\r\nTo: Lambert, Mike\r\nSubject: PAC Ideas\r\n\r\nMike,\r\nIn case this will help, below are a few ideas to liven up PAC meetings we are discussing at the interim reviews:\r\n\r\n?

She has polled parks across the US asking about their volunteer awards program. Denise had done the same in the southeast and I had worked on the guidelines to get the approval of the director to award for hours worked.  You and the other DISU?s saw my draft a few months ago at the Archdale that scaled back the awards for hours worked.\r\n\r\nContinue to hold the volunteer recognition request for your parks until we can get the guidelines approved.  Tara is meeting with the director today and will bring up the issue again.\r\n\r\nLike all of you, I want to get this backlog of requests approved.  \r\n\r\nMichael D. Lambert\r\nDistrict Superintendents,\r\nWith the implementation of the Central Reservation System, gift cards will now be awarded in addition to the letter of appreciation for volunteer service.  After a volunteer has completed either 100 or 200 hours of service at a park, they are eligible to receive a gift card from DPR and a letter of appreciation from the Director.  Once service hours are completed, the Park Superintendent is to send a memorandum to me indicating the request that a gift card be issued.  Attached is an example of an e-memorandum formatted with information that should be included in the request.  Once I review the memorandum, I will forward the information to Adrienne Mccoig.  She will compose the appreciation letter for the Director?s signature and apply the appropriate funds to a gift card for either one or two weeks of free camping.  The amount applied to the card will be the cost of a basic campsite with picnic table and grill.  The amount added to the gift card for one week of free camping will be $126.  The amount for two weeks camping will be $252.  All letters and cards will be mailed from the Director?s office.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

A few months ago Lindy had asked me to circulate information to the Division to ensure that each park identify a web liaison. This individual is responsible for making changes and updates to the website.  Unfortunately inclement weather affects our staff as well.  With the snow totals that we had last week I?m certain that a majority of the staff that were responsible for the website were absent or either left work early.  I would expect that Office Assistants are primarily responsible for updating web content at the park level.  Most only work Monday through Friday.  It appears to me that we will need to identify another person at the park that can make changes and provide real time updates to the web.  It will need to be a Ranger or Superintendent that lives in the park.  I can hammer the point to the District Superintendents but invariably we will continue to have issues due to scheduled time off.  I?m not sure I have a definitive answer to fine tune the process.  I am open for suggestions.  In the WEDI all closings are reported to the District Office.  The list below is the information that I?ve received thus far.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe status of WEDI parks as of Sunday @ 5 PM is:\r\n?	LANO-closed, ice on roads. May open Monday. CRMO-open. SOMO-open. GORG-open.

There were several parks we never heard from until too late to do any good. I don\'t have any confidence that the list we posted of closed parks was altogether accurate. Our saving grace may have been the weather was so bad, nobody was moving around much. We actually have more problems when bad weather is more localized or \"a little bit bad.\"\r\n\r\nJust to open the discussion, I\'d propose this:\r\n\r\nIt\'s no problem for me or Lindy to post a generic alert along these lines: Weather conditions in the western half of N.C. have closed some state parks and others may close on short notice. Please check the park\'s main page or call the park office for current conditions.\r\n\r\nI propose we make the parks responsible for an additional alert on that park\'s main page when they close that simply says: Park closed due to weather conditions. If they\'re having connectivity problems or other woes, it\'s no problem for Lindy or me to do this for them if they can call us -- or the district OA or even another park. Whenever we try to maintain a list from here of who\'s closed, it\'s invariably inaccurate due to sins of omission, especially so in the day or two after an event as they reopen. The parks do need to eventually train all staff to post alerts, or at least all staff living in the park likely to be stuck with the task.\r\n\r\nThoughts or other ideas on how to fine tune this process?\r\n\r\nch\r\n \r\nCharlie Peek\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nN.C.

Their awards program is based on a teamwork approach where the entire staff from a park is recognized for the successes of the park.\r\n\r\nEleven awards are presented annually.  Their awards are for Park of the Year, outstanding Hospitality, Outstanding Park Maintenance, Outstanding Park Sponsored Special Event, Outstanding Resource Management, Outstanding Volunteer Program, and Outstanding Overall Interpretive Program. \r\n \r\nThere system is divided into four regions similar to our district.  Each region or district selects a Park of the Year.  The Park that is selected for each district is presented to the central office/awards committee to determine the statewide park of the year.  \r\n\r\nIn late July each park prepares a proposal or annual report that justifies why they should be chosen for the award.  These proposals consist of simple memorandums to ring binders filled with information and photographs.  Each District Superintendent would choose the park of the year for his or her district. \r\n\r\nAwards are given at the annual Superintendent?s Conference.  The Superintendent is recognized with the award during the conference.   The Park of the Year for the entire Division is presented at the park during a luncheon attended by the Director and senior staff.  The media is also invited to attend the award.\r\nI am attaching additional information including scoring sheets.  After you have a chance to review give me a call.  \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

It appears that LURI has not deposited any funds during this fiscal year.  Those funds should total $1,369.00.  The attached spreadsheet indicates that the last bank deposit took place on June 29, 2009.  LURI did a total of 13 deposits during that year.  Total deposited funds for campsites and picnic shelters totaled $2028.00 for the period 7-1-08 through 1-6-09.  This year the total amount that has been deposited is $803.00.  This amount only covers deposits made by the DPR budget office for transactions made through the CRS call center and internet.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the park and discuss this issue with park staff.  We should be making daily deposits and should never keep over $250.00 on hand at the park.  Notes attached.\r\n\r\nMichael D.

I don?t know this is a visitor.\r\n\r\nThis e-mail is to notify you of a complaint directed toward Ranger Ed Wilkerson at MEMO.  It is possible it is a private matter and not directly MEMO related\r\n\r\nI, Erik Nygard, NODI, received a voice mail message to contact Eddie (no last name) at the number referenced below.  Attempting to return his call, I left a message on Eddie?s voice mail I was attempted to return his call.   A few days later, Monday this week, He returned the call indicating he wanted to complain about Ranger Ed Wilkerson.  He indicated Ed Wilkerson was working out of his jurisdiction and misrepresenting himself as a Highway Patrol Officer and some other complaints about being rude and what not.  He then indicated something about Wilkerson?s private property and it being next to the property he hunts.  He said he was  a member of a hunt club near MEMO and that weren?t hunting the park.\r\n\r\nI politely asked him if I could have Ed Wilkerson?s new Supervisor, Bill Meyer contact him to investigate his complaint as I wanted Supt. Meyer to have a chance to handle it at the local level as Wilkerson?s supervisor.  He indicated he wanted to write a letter to whomever was in charge.  I assured him any letter Supt. Meyer receives I would deal with it appropriately and  I would see that it would be provided to my supervisor.  Again, I wanted Supt. Meyer to have the chance to deal with his problem directly as the supervisor.  He agreed that would be fine.  He was thankful and appreciative of what we do in DPR.  He indicated he would wait for Supt. Meyer?s call but he still wanted to write a letter.  He never asked me for an address.  I would have given him one if he insisted.\r\n\r\nI informed Supt. Meyer to contact him and investigate the complaint and give him Meyer MEMO address first, then my address , or CHOP address if he insisted to go higher with a letter.\r\n\r\nHe may write a letter directly to DPR.  I?ll keep you informed if Supt. Meyer has contact with him.\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\nErik Nygard, District Superintendent\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/RE_Visitor_complaint_at_MEMO.htm','','2010-01-21 19:02:18','Williams5894'),(1109,'Operations','2010-01-08','','OPS STAFF',',','','2009 RECORD ATTENDANCE AT STATE PARKS- GOVENOR\'S OFFICE','STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA\r\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\r\n20301 MAIL SERVICE CENTER ?

State parks in North Carolina reported record attendance in 2009 of 14.16 million visits, a jump of 13 percent over the previous year, and up 5 percent from the previous record set in 2007, according to the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\nOver the past 25 years, the state parks system has seen a dramatic 238 percent increase in visitation. In 1984, 5.9 million people visited state parks and state recreation areas.\r\n\r\n?It?s obvious North Carolinians and visitors to our state recognize the tremendous value our state parks offer in terms of affordable family experiences and respite from a difficult economy,? said Gov. Bev Perdue. ?Every visitor to the state parks can also take pride in this state?s long history of conservation of its remarkable natural resources.?\r\n\r\nThe state parks system manages more than 208,000 acres, including 34 state parks and four state recreation areas and a system of state natural areas dedicated to natural resource protection.\r\n\r\nAmong the parks and recreation areas, 22 reported increases in attendance in 2009. Jockey?s Ridge State Park in Dare County reported the highest attendance at 1.4 million visits, an increase of 2 percent over last year.\r\n\r\nOther parks with significant increases were Cliffs of the Neuse State Park in Wayne County (42 percent), Crowders Mountain State Park in Gaston County (58 percent), Dismal Swamp State Park in Camden County (59 percent), Jordan Lake State Recreation Area in Chatham County (52 percent) and Mount Mitchell State Park in Yancey County (77 percent). The popular summit area at Mount Mitchell reopened in 2008 upon the completion of a new observation deck at the highest point in the eastern United States.\r\n\r\n?Beyond the quality recreation experiences, health benefits and exposure to the natural world, state parks also offer economic benefits to the local communities where they?re located,? said Lewis Ledford, state parks director. ?A 2008 economic study revealed the state parks system has an annual economic impact of more than $400 million, much of it in direct contributions to local tourism economies.?\r\n\r\nThe study by North Carolina State University?s Department of Parks Recreation and Tourism Management determined that tourist visitors spend an average $23.56 a day to enjoy the state parks. The complete study can be found at http://www.ncparks.gov/News/media_room/main.php.\r\n\r\n(EDITORS: Complete 2009 attendance records are available on the Web at www.ncparks.gov.

It will take a while for you to prepare the submission forms for all of the rules (one form per rule, except for repeals, which should be combined) and to ?redo? the rules for filing for permanent rulemaking.  By ?redo? I am referring to changing the introduction line to show the current action (?is adopted? ?is repealed? ?is amended?) and include the volume and page of the NC Register in which each rule appears.  I recommend that you get started with this process.  If any of the rules are changed due to comments, you will need to show the changes in the correct format set out by OAH?s rules, and modify the introduction line showing that the rule has been ?adopted with changes? or amended, whichever the case may be.\r\n \r\nLet me know if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nNancy Pate\r\nRulemaking and E-Discovery Coordinator\r\nOffice of General Counsel\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/RE_Rule_Filing.htm,file_upload/12A.0101_Org_and_Purp_2010.doc,file_upload/12A.0104_Directory_SP_2010.doc,file_upload/12A.0105_DEFINITIONS_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0104_PERMITS_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0201_NAT_CULT_RES_PROT_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0203_METAL_DET_PROH_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0204_ROCK_OR_CLIFF_CLIMB_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0301_BATHING_SWIMMING_ACT_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0401_DISPOSAL_OF_REFUSE_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0501_VEHICLES_WHERE_PROH_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0502_PARKING_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0601_BOATING_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0602_CAMPING_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0701_SPORTS_AND_GAMES_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.0802_FISHING_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1001_NOISE_REGS_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1003_INTOXICATING_LIQUORS_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1004_ANIMALS_AT_LARGE_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1100_COMMERCIAL_ENTERPRISES_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1100_COMMERCIAL_ENTERPRISES_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1105_PUBLIC_ASSEMBLIES_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1201_CLOSING_AND_OPENING_HOURS_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1205_RESERVATION_PERIOD_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1205_RESERVATION_PERIOD_2010.doc,file_upload/12B.1206_Fees_and_Charges_2010.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12A__0104_Directory_of_State_Park_Areas_By_Year.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12A_.0101_Organization_&_Purpose.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12A_.0105_Definitions.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B__1206_corr_fees_01202010.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0104_Permits.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0104_Permits.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0201_Natural_&_Cultural_Resource_Protection.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0203_Metal_Detectors.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0204_Rock_Climbing_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0301_Bathing_and_Swimming.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0401_Disposal_of_Refuse_&_Garbage_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0501_Vehicle_Rule.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0502_Parking_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0601_Boating.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0602_Camping_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0701_Sports_and_Games.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.0802_Fishing.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1001_Noise_Regulation.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1003_Intoxicating_Liquors-CHRO_&_HARI_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1004_Animals_At_Large_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1101_Commercial_Enterprises.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1105_Public_Assemblies_and_Meetings_10-15-09.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1201_Closing_and_Opening_Hours.doc,file_upload/NCAC_12B_.1205_Reservation_Periods_10-15-09.doc','','2010-01-25 19:59:46','Williams5894'),(1119,'Operations','2010-01-14','','CHOP','DISW','','Legislative contact report for Senator Basnight, Representative Owens, and Secretary of Commerce Crisp to the Dismal Swamp State Park.

We have invited several people from other areas in North Carolina and from out-of-state to camp with us.  Their continuing complaint is that they cannot make the reservations work either.\r\n\r\nHow strange is that when a recent news story commented that the park system is half full this year due to the new reservation system?  That would be too impossible to grasp that I am a member of a small group for which the system will not work.\r\n\r\nWe are reserving in Virginia with no problems.  It is ludicrous that I have trouble returning to my home area and the State Recreation Area of my choice because the computer system won?t take my reservation.\r\n\r\nHow about we get this thing fixed.  I watched last year as it took months and months to get outdated and outmoded computers operational at the $250,000 each gate houses.  Whoever is doing and overseeing these two jobs are not doing their jobs and your division is not being accountable to its users , us the taxpayers and campers.\r\n\r\nLet?s fix something in the existing state parks rather than spend all the resources with the hoop-la around new parks.  It would be a shame to have to form a public group to make every issue blatantly public, through media and websites, like stopped up toilets, overflowing dump stations, no first-come sites at Kerr Lake, a shameful shambles of a reservations system and every other mistake. \r\n\r\nR.

The Backwards Bullet Award was retired.  This was done at the request and with the approval of a majority of the superintendents.  There was a feeling that this award had lost some of the amicability that it started with in 1995.  With the departure of this award, the superintendents hoped to start a new tradition with a more positive award that could encourage and recognize the development and accomplishments of a park as a whole. At the same time, it is no secret that the awards program has faltered over the past couple of years.  We also hope to bolster this program with new categories of awards; develop ways to allow for easier nominations;  and increase the frequency of presentation opportunities.\r\n\r\nWith this idea in mind, The Awards Committee has been tasked with soliciting comments from the superintendents and field staff and administrative staff as to the best way to accomplish these goals.  I would like to receive comments from all staff concerning a makeover of our current awards program.  We are interested in your ideas on how we should receive nominations, new categories of awards that could be developed, and any general changes that you think could make the Division?s awards program work more efficiently.  We are open to any ideas and will try to implement as many a feasible.\r\n\r\nPlease share this opportunity to comment with your entire staff.  I would like to have comments by the 10th of February.

All changes are noted in red for all three documents.  You will notice significant changes to the Summary of Financial Information.  We were able to provide more accurate training information by reviewing actual travel authorizations completed for Law Enforcement training for fiscal years 2005-2009.  Earlier we had relied on estimates from the total training budget.\r\n\r\nAs I?ve previously noted, the challenge in accessing this information for the state park system is the recognition that our Park Rangers are also required to do other tasks. For example our rangers are certified as  environmental educators (ties to our mandated mission), and they also have certifications in Search & Rescue,  EMS, wild land fire control, and other natural resource management programs. \r\n \r\nAdditionally they are directly responsible for daily managing and operating park facilities, from a centralized reservation system for camping areas, plus swim beaches, picnic areas, cabins, and various contracted services such as the Hang Gliding at Jockeys Ridge, to the restaurant at Mount Mitchell, the marinas at Falls and Jordan lakes, to the operation of the attraction at Chimney Rock.  Further, they also handle the business management of the parks ? from purchases and procurement, to hiring and personnel supervision of personnel (temporary, seasonal and permanent) and volunteers, to the business management consideration:  park revenue collections, deposits, and day-to-day business requirements the park units across the state, where annual visitation exceeds 14 million. \r\n\r\nIn essence this all ties in large part to being efficient.  It is simply impractical to have a law enforcement officer only do law enforcement work at Mount Mitchell, while other personnel are hired to do the other work referenced above.  It?s certainly a challenge to have our law enforcement staff serve as multi-specialists, but it provides for an efficient and effective service in our view.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of this info has been compiled by Mike Lambert, our Chief of Operations, 919-715-7602.  Please do not hesitate to contact either of us if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nLewis\r\n\r\nLewis R. Ledford, Director\r\nNC State Parks and Recreation\r\n512 N.

As promised, we are sending you a draft copy of the summary of your agency?s information.  It consists of much of the information you provided to us, but it also contains additional information derived from interviews and analysis of statutes and other data.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure the accuracy of the summary, we would appreciate your review of the draft and returning it to us no later than Tuesday, February 16th:\r\n\r\n1.	Please confirm the accuracy of the information in the attached summary, and where needed, insert edits and additions or other changes.  Please use another color, such as red, in making changes, or use the strikethrough feature to recommend deletion, so that we are aware of your suggested modifications and corrections (please do not delete).\r\n\r\n2.	For the areas that have been highlighted in yellow, please correct the information or insert additional information.  The highlighted areas indicate that we need additional information or we are not certain that we correctly captured what was said during our meetings and telephone discussions with you.  Please make the necessary changes.\r\n\r\n3.	During our review of all the state law enforcement entities, some recurring issues have emerged on which we would like additional data to ensure we fully understand the impact.  As such, we have developed a spreadsheet with 3 tabs.  Some of the data is already filled in, based on what you provided in your submissions or in interviews; please confirm the accuracy, or make changes.  Where you don?t see data, please enter it.   \r\n\r\nThe 3 tabs on the spreadsheet are:\r\n\r\nTab 1:  Software/Systems Routinely Used To Carry Out Law Enforcement Duties ?\r\n\r\n?	We have included a listing of the software that you indicated was used by your agency to carry out law enforcement duties.  Please confirm that this is a complete list, and indicate whether your agency owns the software.  If you do not own it, please indicate who does, and what your annual costs are and the uses.  [Please note:  if there is any software whose name should not be published in our report which is a public document, please highlight this in blue on the spreadsheet.  We will simply group this as ?other software? and report the costs].\r\n\r\nTab 2:  Listing of Selected Law Enforcement Equipment & Communications ?\r\n\r\n?	Please confirm where your agency is in implementing Viper\r\n\r\n?	Please confirm that we have the correct listing of specific law enforcement equipment for your agency, or add it if no information is on the attached\r\n\r\nTab 3:  Training Costs and Where Training Was Delivered ?\r\n\r\n?

The document is currently at his level. Casey may have mentioned to you the division is currently reviewing our trail guidelines and overall trail management to include mountain bike trails. Casey is part of this effort. Prior to approving the MOU, we would prefer to see the final recommendations of this review effort to avoid an inconsistency between the MOA & the guidelines revision. At the same time, we understand the importance of getting the MOU in place. We are checking with the working group to see what the timeline is for finishing the review. If the review process is not nearing completion, We will move the MOA forward. Either way, Casey or I will let you know the document status. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/LANO_Mountain_Bike_Trail_MOA_Agreement_.htm,file_upload/LANO_Mountain_Bike_Trail_MOA_1-27-2010.pdf,file_upload/2010_07/FW_LANO_Bike_Trail_MOA_7-5-2010.htm,file_upload/2010_07/LANO_Itusi_MOA_Phase_V_FINAL_7.2.10.docx,file_upload/2010_07/FW_LANO_Bike_Trail_MOA_Response_To_J._Archer_7-7-2010.txt,file_upload/2010_07/FW_LANO_Bike_Trail_MOA.txt,file_upload/2010_10/RE_LANO_MOA.txt','','2010-10-06 11:49:26','Williams5894'),(1172,'Operations','2010-01-29','','PARKS','MIKE','','PARK CLOSURES','District Superintendents,\r\nWith the forecasted winter weather it?s imperative that our visitors be updated with road and facility closures.  The best way to accomplish this is through the Division website.  Our jobs become more difficult anytime severe weather is predicted.  With our Division responsibilities serving on the Emergency Management EOC combined with providing for visitor safety and snow removal our staff have a tremendous workload.  However, that doesn?t relieve us of the responsibility to keep the public informed.  I?m confident that each of you are informed with needs and closures within your district.  \r\n\r\nLater today Charlie and Lindy will be placing a general notice on the Division web page indicating the possibility of park closures across the state due to the impending storm.  Visitors will be directed to contact the park by phone or check the specific park web page to get up to date information.  Therefore, make sure that each park in your district updates the webpage indicating closures and current conditions.  I am attaching the instructions provided by Lindy.  Charlie also mentioned that he would assist those parks that could not update their page.  They can simply e-mail or call him if they are unable to follow the directions that are attached to the e-mail.  \r\n\r\nI personally consider these updates critical to visitor safety.  There have been instances in the past where certain people take advantage of extreme weather events to push personal limits in the outdoors resulting in search and rescue responsibilities for our staff.\r\n\r\nAs important as it is to update our visitors on closures and conditions.   It is equally important to advise the public when facilities reopen.  Sometimes that requirement gets lost after the impact of the storm.  \r\n\r\nAs a reminder our central reservation contractor Infospherix can help with disseminating facility closure information.  The call center also has the ability to contact visitors that have made reservations in the event that facilities need to be closed.  I would suggest contacting Infospherix at datamgmt@infospherix.com to communicate closures and needs.  Of course park staff can also call 877-722-6762 during business hours.  \r\n\r\nRemind your staff to be aware of their own personal safety when conducting park operations during severe weather.  Thanks and be safe.  \r\n\r\nMichael D.

Fees for entry, parking, and other activities (obviously not the gift shop items!)\r\n?	Whether there is a \"friends society\" (or other supporting organization)\r\n?	Whether there is a gift shop (and if so, is it run by the state or the friends group)\r\n?	The last time fees were changed (if applicable)\r\n?	Total Expenditures broken down into Personnel and Non-Personnel\r\n?	Total Revenues broken down by source - General Fund Appropriation, Admission Fees, Other revenues\r\n?	Number of FTE\r\n?	Acres of Attraction Site\r\n?	Whether the attraction has a special fund\r\n?	Source of revenue for the special fund\r\n?	Use of the special fund\r\n?	etc...\r\n\r\nThe attached excel file includes a tentative list of attractions.  I realize that I am defining attractions more broadly than the typical DENR definition (i.e. I\'ve included more than the zoo, aquariums, and museums).  There may be a good reason some of these sites should not be considered attractions; if so, please include what data you have for the location as well as a description of why it should not be considered an attraction.\r\nYou\'ll see that I started gathering this information in the attached spreadsheet.

I think this is going to be a great opportunity for students who attend HBCU Schools  locally and from other areas as well.  My goal is to employ a diverse group of students who would like to explore the environment,  and project their learning skills to help maintain our natural resources.  I spoke with Mr. Michael Eure at St. Augustine College, he is interested in providing us with students who are seeking employment for the summer.  These students will complete a PD 107 state application and attach a resume.  I will set a date and time with you once these applications are received  so we can  review the applications for those positions provided.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAudrey Phillips-Hunter','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Final_Seasonal_HR_Recruitment_Info.doc,file_upload/FW_Gateway_Program.htm,file_upload/RE_Gateway_Program.htm','','2017-08-02 16:55:46','Williams5894'),(1245,'Operations','2010-02-22','','Johnny & Permit Agency','Denise','','GOCR Dinah\'s Landing Stormwater Permit','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/FW_GOCR_-_Dinah','','2010-03-03 13:11:32','Williams5894'),(1277,'Operations','2010-03-03','','CHOP','Tom Jackson','','NERI Volunteer Recognition Request-Marcye Blatny','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_03/Certificate_Volunteer_Marcye_Blatny.doc,file_upload/2010_03/FW_Volunteer_Recognition.htm','','2010-03-03 13:29:40','Williams5894'),(1246,'Operations','2010-02-22','','Lew-CHOP','Andrew Chilton','','Concerns Correspondence, radio dispatch, concealed carry weapon policy, emergency call back','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Corresp_Mike_2-18-10.pdf,file_upload/2010_03/Chilton_letter_to_Director_1-27-10.pdf,file_upload/2010_03/Chilton_Response_3-1-10.doc','','2010-03-03 13:23:43','Williams5894'),(1247,'Operations','2010-02-22','','Denise','MIKE','','Completed OPS requested columns per Request','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Denise_Copy_of_DENR_Attractions_Data_2-8-10_(2).xls','','2010-03-03 13:11:12','Williams5894'),(1248,'OPAA','2010-02-22','','Denise','MIKE','','COMPLETED PORTION OF SPREADSHEET FROM TAMMY-ATTRACTIONS INFORMATION','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Denise_Copy_of_DENR_Attractions_Data_2-8-10_(2).xls','','2011-02-23 13:09:21','Williams5894'),(1249,'Operations','2010-02-22','','Director','MIKE','','CRS ADDITIONAL UNIT REQUEST-RVP PREPARATION','','DW','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Copy_of_CRS_Workstation_Survey_edited_01-25-10_(3)_(2).xls,file_upload/Copy_of_CRS_Workstation_Survey_edited_01-25-10_(3).xls,file_upload/CRS_2-16-2010_Memo.doc','','2010-03-03 13:10:59','Williams5894'),(1250,'Operations','2010-02-22','','Tammy Dodd','MIKE','','TRAVEL AUTHORIZATION- LE INSTRUCTORS SALEMBURG-OC RECERTIFICATION','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/OC_Recert__TA_1-27-10.xls,file_upload/Adjustment_2-15OC_Recert__TA_1-27-10.pdf,file_upload/Adjustment_2-15OC_Recert__TA_1-27-10.xls,file_upload/Since_this_class_is_an_8_hour.docx,file_upload/Revised_Travel_1-27-2010_OCSpray.pdf,file_upload/Adjustment_2-15OC_Recert__TA_1-27-10.pdf','','2010-03-03 13:10:47','Williams5894'),(1251,'Operations','2010-02-22','','HR','MIKE','','HR FORMS PREPARED BY CHOP','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Approved_REs_2-19-2010.pdf','','2010-03-03 13:10:28','Williams5894'),(1256,'Operations','2010-02-24','','Adrian','MIKE','','Sign Request for WIUM','attached','emailed 2/24','','','','complete','','','file_upload/Sign_Request_WIUM_2-24-2010.pdf,file_upload/Sign_Request_WIUM.htm','','2010-02-24 13:24:56','Williams5894'),(1252,'Operations','2010-02-22','','CHOP','DW','','FACILITY FEES DOCUMENT FROM STAFF DIRECTIVE','','','2/22/2010','','','complete','','','file_upload/fees.pdf','','2010-02-22 15:54:53','Williams5894'),(1253,'NODI','2010-02-19','email','DISU','Bryce Fleming','KELA','KELA Surplus Trucks 2010-02','','Mailed to JoAnne','2/22/2010','electronic','','complete','','','file_upload/KELA_Surplus_Trucks_2010-02.pdf','','2010-02-22 14:03:10','Cucurullo6876'),(1254,'Operations','2010-02-22','other','Tammy Dodd','MIKE','','Travel Authorization George, Glenn CHRO $140.53 ','','Tammy\'s mailbox after CHOP sign','','','','complete','','','','','2010-02-22 15:52:38','Williams5894'),(1255,'Operations','2010-02-22','','Tammy Dodd','MIKE','','Travel Expense Reimbursement SODI Mitchell, Pete $106.55','','to Tammy Dodd after CHOP sign...DISU has copy see travel email folder','2/22/2010','','','complete','','','','','2010-02-22 15:54:14','Williams5894'),(1257,'Administration','2010-02-24','','DIR','Lambert','','Entrance sign construction at JORD (Seaforth, Robeson Creek boat ramp access)','','','','','','complete','','','','','2010-06-30 14:43:37','Kuchnia5239'),(1258,'Administration','2010-02-22','','DIR','Lambert','','Construction approval form for DISW (replica of still)','to Howerton','','2/25/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-02-25 18:23:50','McCoig5239'),(1259,'Administration','2010-02-22','','DIR','Reuter','','RFA -

My understanding is that full day rates are often offered at a discounted price rather than paying twice the half day rate but that this may only be applicable to certain parks.\r\n\r\nCould you let me know how the data team should proceed with the rates?\r\n\r\nAlso, I\'d discussed this with Tom Howard as well, but Outdoor classrooms are generally sold through the public site and call center as well. If we continue to do full day and half day rates for that facility type, we run the risk of double-booking. (One customer books in the call center for the half day rate and then another customer reserves on the public site for the full day on the same day).\r\n\r\nPer Tom Howard\'s advice, I\'ve spoken with Kelly at Goose Creek, which has outdoor classrooms on the reservation system, and have determined it should be local sale until we can determine if outdoor classrooms need to stay local sale only and further so we can continue on with the inventory process. As far as the facility type goes, Hanging Rock is also listed to have Outdoor Classrooms but theirs are Local Sale in the system as well. It may be easiest to keep that facility type as local sale only. \r\n\r\nIf there\'s anything further I can do to be of assistance please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nNick\r\n\r\nNicholas James\r\nActiveOutdoors, Campgrounds\r\nClient Services Manager\r\n1 Technology Drive\r\nFrostburg, MD 21532\r\n(301) 687-8256 Office\r\n(301) 707-9583 Cell\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_03/RE_2011_Inventory_-_ClassroomAuditorium_Rates_.htm','','2010-03-03 13:49:26','Williams5894'),(1279,'Operations','2010-03-03','','CHOP','Erik Nygard','','PIMO Pavilon Justification','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_03/FW_PIMO_Pavilion_Demolition_Justification.htm,file_upload/2010_03/pavilion_justification.doc','','2010-03-03 13:54:14','Williams5894'),(1280,'Administration','2010-03-03','','DIR','','Alcorn','Memo from Lew to MPT - PARTF Applications with Eligibility Issues','to Dan Oakley','Dan, Since you\'ve reviewed these before - would you please?

The general consensus was that the training was beneficial.  Suggestions that I have for next week; Provide answers to the questions submitted prior to the training.  You and I had discussed this Monday afternoon.  If we can have the document before Friday then we can distribute to the staff attending the conference next week.  I would still offer the opportunity for staff to ask additional questions and demonstrate the process using the system if requested.  I think the demonstration is very helpful.  As you know changing the settings on each laptop is a real pain.  It also opens us up to viruses.  Nick was going to check with Development this week to see if they had a fix that would allow us to access the training module without changing settings.  I?ll wait to hear back from Nick on that issue.  I?ll be out of the office most of today but contact Denise if you have questions or need additional information.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nMichael D.

We did not have the current park level management team in place when the last GMP was completed.  This has lead to some confusion concerning some of the projects.

These rules become effective May 1, 2010.  Over the past year, both field staff and various division sections have provided input into this process of developing these rule amendments. In some cases it?s been twenty-five years since some of these rules have been amended and it has been a long and thorough process.\r\n\r\nAs with any new rule or amendment, it is important that educational enforcement be used to initially inform park visitors of these changes.  All of these rules were listed in the North Carolina Register and were open to public comment.  However, in most instances our visitors will be unfamiliar with any change to our rules and will need to be notified and educated on the reasons and scope for each rule.  This could include signage, website notifications, interpretative programs, verbal warnings and written warning notices before more serious enforcement action is taken.  Some of these rule changes may be controversial with park visitors but with your explanation and educational approach, compliance will hopefully be gained. \r\n \r\nIn the attachment you will find a copy of each new or amended rule along with a brief explanation for the change.  As you read through these rules you will notice that certain rules have relatively minor changes.  In most cases these changes were incorporated to address operational modifications such as the central reservation system.   Other changes are more significant such as the fee schedule increase and changes to the public assemblies and meetings rule. \r\n  \r\nExpect a press release in the next few days that will outline the changes to our fee schedule.  During the 2009 legislative session our Division was directed to offset our general fund appropriations by increasing fees.  The fee increase for facilities and services averages 10% across the board.  The Carolina Beach Marina fees are slightly higher.  Effective May 1, 2010, Infospherix will begin charging the new rates.  All reservations that were made prior to that date will be charged the current rate.  You are expected to begin charging the new rates at the park level on May 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nOverall, the amendments are based on staff input and recommendations over the past several years.   These improvements were incorporated to help address changes in park visitor activities, to increase natural resource protection and to provide a mechanism for managing specific park operations.\r\n\r\nEventually, we will be sending a certified copy of the Parks and Recreation Area Rules to each park.  Later this week the amended rules will be available on the Office of Administrative Hearings website.  Chief Ranger, Dowdy will be sending a link to the website and copies for posting and enforcement once these rules are listed in the Administrative code.  The copy provided in this e-mail is not to be used for posting.  It is intended for staff educational purposes only.\r\n\r\nPlease make your staff aware of these changes.  You can forward any questions to your District Superintendent, Chief Ranger Bryan Dowdy or Law Enforcement Specialist, Phil King.\r\n\r\nI would like to personally acknowledge Chief Ranger, Bryan Dowdy, DENR Rules Coordinator Nancy Pate and DENR Counsel Dan Oakley for their efforts during the rule revision process.   \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMichael D.

We both want the CRP LLC to succeed and appreciate their partnership. We also understand the importance of Chimney Rock Park to the local community. \r\n \r\nAt the same time, we support following the attached Design & Development time line presented at the May 26th DPR / LLC meeting. The CI projects described in the attached document address emergency egress deficiencies identified as immediate needs in the 2007 F CAP Report. The elevator project is equally important in order to provide an emergency egress in the event of a elevator failure.  \r\n \r\nIt has been over 3 years since the F CAP Report identified a number of immediate needs within Chimney Rock Park. We have a responsibility to the public and employees utilizing CRP to pursue these projects as the funding becomes available.    \r\n \r\nAdrienne and I fully support keeping CRP open to the public as much as possible while the CI projects take place if the public access can be done in a safe manner for all concerned and the public access does not delay the projects completion. \r\n \r\nThank you for soliciting our comments on this matter.\r\n \r\nTom\r\n \r\n \r\nTom Jackson\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_05/RE_CHRO_letter_to_LLC.htm,file_upload/2010_05/Letter_to_CHRO_LLC_5-4-10.doc,file_upload/2010_05/CHRO_letter_to_LLC.htm,file_upload/2010_05/Draft_DPR_Housing_Policy_with_Revisions._Version_2.5.1.10.doc,file_upload/2010_05/RE_CHRO-draft_letter_to_LLC.htm,file_upload/2010_05/Letter_to_CHRO_LLC_5-6-10dr_edits.doc,file_upload/2010_06/CRP_Projects_Time_Line_5-26-2010.pdf,file_upload/2010_06/Response_to_CRM_LLC_Request_Re_CI_PRojects_for_2010_through_2012...._6.8.2010.doc,file_upload/2010_06/Certified_Signature_Lambert_6-28-2010.pdf,file_upload/2010_06/CHOP_sworn_statement_6.doc','','2010-07-22 18:26:58','Williams5894'),(1375,'Operations','2010-05-05','','CHOP','ANGELIA ALLCOX','','HOUSING POLICY DRAFTS AND CORRESPONDENCE','Operations Staff ?\r\n\r\nAttached find the Updated Draft of the DPR Housing Policy and DPR Housing Agreement with revisions in red per comments suggested in the April 26th Staff Meeting.\r\n\r\nA Draft Copy of the DPR Annual Facility Safety Audit & Home Inspection Form is also attached.\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay.

Crawford\r\nTower Engineering Professionals\r\n703 Junction Boulevard\r\nRaleigh, NC 27603-5263\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Crawford;\r\n\r\nWe received your letter dated March 21, 2010 regarding the proposed 100-ft Self Support Emergency Services Communication Tower for Mount Jefferson, at Mount Jefferson State Natural Area in West Jefferson, North Carolina which will be a component of the NC Highway Patrol?s VIPER program.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the area for the proposed tower site is near the summit of Mt. Jefferson and within the boundaries of Mt. Jefferson State Natural Area. This site is designated as a National Natural Landmark by the US Secretary of the Interior and requires special considerations when the area is to be disturbed.  Thus, our Division is very concerned about the environmental and public access impact that this new construction and the removal of the existing structures on the summit will cause. \r\n\r\nFollowing a review of your letter and site plans, we are requesting the following during all phases of this project;\r\n?	The Park Superintendent and other Division representatives deemed appropriate, will be included in any pre-construction and construction meetings with the various contractors and NC Highway Patrol. \r\n?	That the TEP Engineers and NC Highway Patrol liaisons impress upon the on-site contractors that the mountain is an ecological sensitive resource and public use area and that vegetation and park facilities will be protected as much as possible during construction.\r\n?	The Park Superintendent will be consulted regarding any proposed or actual damage to the summit access road, trees or park facilities during the construction.\r\n?	The Park Superintendent will be consulted regarding and prior to the repair or replacement of any vegetation or park infrastructure that was damaged and that the contractors will be responsible for this repair/replacement/re-vegetation.\r\n?	The Park Superintendent will be consulted regarding the use of native materials, colors and designs that will be used in the permanent structures so that they will blend in with the natural environment.\r\n?	The Division will require that privacy slats of a neutral color agreed upon by the Park Superintendent and contractors be used in the chain linked fence surrounding the communication tower compound.\r\n?	That it is understood by the NC Highway Patrol, Tower Engineering Professionals and all contractors that the public will be using the park access road and surrounding trails during the construction and that contractors will work with on-site park staff to ensure the safety of the public and minimize public access impacts to the extent possible while allowing contractors to work at the site.\r\n\r\n\r\nKyle W. Crawford\r\nPage 2\r\nJune 28, 2010\r\n\r\nFrom this point forward, please communicate directly with Park Superintendent Joe Shimel at Mount Jefferson State Natural Area for site issues or questions.  He may be contacted at joseph.shimel@ncdenr.gov or at the park office at (336) 982-2587.\r\n\r\nIf these conditions and parameters are agreed upon by Tower Engineering Professionals, you may proceed with site and pre-construction preparations.  Again, thank you for the opportunity to review this construction proposal and we look forward to working with your company in assisting the NC Highway Patrol in completing this communication project.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

To get the largest data samples, our surveys will be done during peak visitor attendance hours.  Is this information that you might have for each park with an exhibit hall?

During the peak exhibit hall attendance hours, what kinds of visitors are in attendance? (i.e., families, school groups, other specific user group)\r\n?	Is the type of visitor who would be in attendance during the exhibit hall\'s busiest hours a representative sample of the types of visitors who come to the park overall?\r\n?

The purpose of the meeting was to look at his firewood product and discuss the Division procedure for purchasing firewood.   I wanted to provide you his contact information along with some information about the product. \r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel sells packaged firewood by the bundle.  You will see from the photographs that he uses all hardwood.  The price per bundle is $3.  He delivers the wood in a pallet of 63 bundles and can haul up to eight bundles on his box truck.  He is open to selling firewood in any area of the state.  I explained to Mr. McDaniel that most parks purchase their firewood locally however certain parks have their firewood delivered from outside the immediate area.  Please provide this information to your Superintendents in case any park wants to consider purchasing firewood for resale or is considering a different vendor.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder Our Division is covered under a waiver of competition for purchase for resale items.  The waiver provides our staff the ability to purchase direct from a vendor without a competitive bid.  However, we need to seek the lowest price available for the products we purchase and consider using different vendors when feasible.  The wavier covers only items that are purchased for over the counter resale.  I have attached a copy of the waiver. I will bring a couple of firewood bundles to the staff meeting on August 9th. \r\n \r\nThe Division warehouse has purchased two ice coolers to be used at a park or recreation area that wants to consider selling ice.  The coolers would work well for a campground, visitor center or other public use area.  The coolers are designed for outdoor use.  It?s a good opportunity to pursue additional revenue generation at the park level or replace an aging or outdated cooler.  If no one has an interest we will consider installing these coolers as a pilot program in one of our state parks or recreation areas to measure revenue generation potential and improve visitor services.

This was in addition to a 500K reduction from an increase in fees associated with the rule revision.  Also, we should expect an additional 1% hold back. \r\n\r\nI?m sure that additional direction will be forthcoming after our park budgets are established.  At that point we should have a true picture of how these reductions will affect individual operating budgets.  Until that time review the attached information and let me know if you have questions.\r\n\r\nContinue to take a conservative approach when requesting travel or purchasing goods and services.  \r\n\r\nI would suggest not forwarding this information at this time.

I have spoken to you about this during our monthly staff meetings.  I explained that I would review time from the previous week on Mondays.  This helps me to spend less time logging into Beacon to determine if my staff have released their time.  So far this week I have logged into Beacon at least three times to approve time realizing not all of my staff have released their time from the previous week.  The Director made it clear at the end of June that each employee was to release their time weekly.  I appreciate those of you that are releasing your time as directed.  The Director also made it clear that Supervisors/Managers are responsible for all staff under their organizational authority.  Therefore anytime an operations employee either seasonal or permanent fails to release their time I am ultimately responsible.  \r\n\r\nAgain this month a list was generated indicating that employees are not releasing and approving time accordingly.  We are already at the middle of August and certain staff have not released time for July.  There will always be extenuating circumstances that may cause a delay in submitting and releasing time but I have a difficult time in understanding why someone still has time unapproved for July.\r\n\r\nI outlined some options to the Director yesterday in an effort to prevent this from happening again.  As a supervisor or manager you are responsible for ensuring compliance.  I expect that all of your staff are releasing their time weekly for approval and accordingly their staff should be following the same procedure..  \r\n\r\nWe have spent entirely too much time over the past few months dealing with time reporting issues.  In anticipation of the end of August and time reporting deadlines I will be approving all released time for August on Friday September 3rd.  Monday is the state Holiday. Please ensure that all of your time for the week has been released for approval on that date. \r\n\r\nThanks,  \r\n\r\nMichael D. Lambert\r\nChief of Operations \r\nNorth Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation\r\n919-715-7602\r\n\r\nE-mail correspondence to and from this address may be subject to the North Carolina Public Records Law and may be disclosed to third parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nLew,\r\n\r\nAfter learning of the issue with timesheets last week involving permanent staff I contacted the Superintendent?s directly requesting that the time be entered immediately along with a reason for the delay.  Below are some examples of the responses I received.  Unfortunately the DISU can only see the employees that they directly supervise.  It is my understanding that the district OA can review the time of others.  I can ask that they review each seasonal and permanent staff member?s time near the end of the month.  I?ll also ask that they continually send out reminders to their district staff.\r\n\r\nMichael D.

The NC Division of Parks and Recreation is committed to providing excellent customer service and strives to be responsive and receptive to all comments, concerns and inquiries from our visitors and the general public.\r\n\r\nJordan Lake is a popular recreation destination, with a reported attendance of over 1.2 million visitors  last year.  The Division operates nine recreation areas on Jordan Lake; five of the nine areas (Crosswinds, Parker\'s Creek, Poplar Point, Vista Point and New Hope Overlook) offer overnight facilities with a combined total of over 1,000 individual camp sites.  \r\n\r\nGiven the high volume of use that these areas enjoy, our operational procedure has been to rotate the year-round status of select camping loops and camping areas annually.  This rotation helps protect the campsites, reduces stress on vegetation/natural resources and gives park staff a chance to make minor and/or major repairs to these facilities.  \r\n\r\nPoplar Point was the fall 2009/winter 2010 year-round campground.  Poplar Point opened March 30, 2009 and will close September 7, 2010, which is approximately 17 months of continuous operation.  I understand that you are a frequent camper at Poplar Point, but this area has been scheduled for closure (September 7, 2010 to April 15, 2011) to accommodate a major maintenance project, with improvements planned for the main park entrance road.  We regret any inconvenience this may cause you and your family this November.    \r\n\r\nWith Poplar Point closed, Crosswinds Campground will now be open year-round to accommodate the fall 2010/winter 2011 camping season.  Loops 1, 2 and 4N will be open at Parker?s Creek Campground until November 29, 2010.  You will find that Parker?s Creek campground does not offer water front electric sites, but Crosswinds does.  Crosswinds also offers double campsites.  These campsites are twice the size of a normal camp site and are charged a double rate.  \r\n\r\nCrosswinds and Poplar Point campgrounds are being operated utilizing the new central reservation system.  Reservations can be made 48 hours in advance and 11 months out by calling, toll-free 1-877-7-CAMP-NC (722-6762) or in person by visiting our park visitor center during regular business hours.  These sites are also available on our web site www.ncparks.gov. Parker?s Creek is a first come, first serve campground.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of which loops stay open during the winter months (November, December, January and February) in that particular campground when it is open year-round:\r\n\r\nCrosswinds  year 2010\r\nArea A ? 47 sites all non-electric\r\nArea B ? 66 sites all electric\r\nArea C ? 57 sites all electric\r\nTotal of 170 campsites\r\n\r\nParker?s Creek year 2011\r\nLoop 1 ? 48 sites (26 electric and 22 non-electric)\r\nLoop 2 ? 34 sites (17 electric and 17 non-electric)\r\nLoop 4N ? 60 sites (32 electric and  28 non-electric) \r\nTotal of  142 sites\r\n\r\nPoplar Point year 2012\r\nLoop C ? 58 sites all electric\r\nLoop E ? 110 sites (61 electric and 49 non-electric)\r\nTotal of 168 campsites\r\n\r\nIf you have park specific questions, please do not hesitate to contact Jordan Lake Park Superintendent Shederick Mole direct at (919) 362-0586.  \r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention and we hope you\'ll continue to enjoy the outdoor recreation opportunities offered by North Carolina State Parks.\r\n\r\nAngelia Allcox, South District Superintendent\r\nNC State Parks\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: VJ Picotte [mailto:vj.picotte@dogstar1.com] \r\nSent: Tuesday, August 17, 2010 3:44 PM\r\nTo: parkinfo@ncmail.net\r\nSubject: Jordan Lake Poplar Point Campground\r\n\r\nAs a frequent camper at Poplar Point, I\'m very upset that the campground has already closed two loops. The remaining loops that reservations can be made on, that have lake front sites are always booked up - though not always used. We haven\'t been able to book a site in months. Then we find out that the camp ground will close on September 7 until April, closing for 8 months. Why is the camp closing for 8 months? I\'ve been told because attendance is down ( really?), budget cuts and maintenance.  I\'m leaning towards a lack of budget, since every year we\'ve been told the site is closed for maintenance and upgrades and nothing really gets upgraded. We\'ve had to gut the grass on the site that we liked to use, so I know there isn\'t alot of site work being done. \r\nWe really love Poplar Point site and love to camp there up to the end of November, as we have done for years. Very sad that we won\'t be able to this year.\r\nVJ Picotte\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_08/COMPLAINT_Reply_to_Jordan_Lake_-_Poplar_Point_Campground_Closure__8.19.10.htm','1656','2010-10-01 12:01:28','Williams5894'),(1601,'Administration','2010-08-20','','DIR','Lambert','','Torte Claim for C.

It includes the survey used by NCOA for their study.   I think the Division could streamline the survey to only use pertinent questions.\r\n\r\nBased on your comments, apparently our reservation system can?t guarantee that only ?officially designated disabled person? have access to reserving our ADA sites.  If that is the case, do we monitor these sites to see if indeed a disabled person is using the site?  \r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that some states require the vehicle at the ADA campsite to have a handicapped license plate or placard hanging from its mirror.\r\n\r\nI know how busy everyone is, but I feel it would  best for the Division to work on a system-wide policy now than to wait for a ADA complaint to be filed against the Division before we address the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for your assistance.\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/Campground_Study_Final_Report_Binder.pdf,file_upload/2010_09/RE_Reservation_Policy_for_Accessible_Campsites.htm','','2010-09-27 12:14:28','Williams5894'),(1620,'Operations','2010-08-26','','CHOP','Kathy Norris/Dan Oakley','','Chimney Rock Management LLC ','','','','electronic','documentum e files','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/KN-2434_2_LTR_NEW.pdf','','2010-09-09 12:32:15','Williams5894'),(1621,'Operations','2010-09-09','','CHOP','Charlie Peek','','LAKE JAMES Visitor Center Event','','','','electronic','documentum e files','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/laja_dedic_summary910.pdf','','2010-09-09 12:30:06','Williams5894'),(1622,'Administration','2010-09-14','','DIR','McNair','','Request to release vacant appropriated positions (33144-STMO, 32827-GOCR, 33180-JONE, 32936-PETT, 32943-Res.

The article stated construction at the Carolina Beach Wildlife ramp would start next month without specifying which date it would commence.  It would be amazing for the Wildlife people to close the Carolina Beach ramp during the month of October which is considered by many to be peak fishing season.  On top of this issue the State Park rangers open late and close the ramp early and lock the gates so you cannot get out if you come in after hours (8am opening and the closing time varies with the month).  We need a ramp that is available through October and hopefully into mid November.\r\nPlease consider the above when planning on construction dates and State Park ramp hours.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing your response,\r\n\r\nWayne Williams\r\nNorth Carolina native son\r\nredfishnc@yahoo.com\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/Carolina_Beach_Wildlife_Ramp.htm','','2010-09-28 11:36:58','Williams5894'),(1647,'Operations','2010-09-28','','Marge','CHOP','','CACR Overhills Foundation Donation','Marge,\r\n\r\nIt was good talking with you today.

The first installment will be in November of this year.  I spoke with David Pearson this morning and he indicated that a November timeframe would allow the Friends group to discuss the donation and plans with their CPA.\r\n\r\nOnce you have contact with the Overhills Foundation please advise if there is additional information that you need from NC State Parks or the Friends of State Parks.  \r\n\r\nThe generous donation provided by the Overhills Foundation will play an important role in interpreting the cultural and natural history associated with the Long Valley Farm.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate everything you have done to coordinate this effort.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael D.

To finish this run in 16 days they have to average 35 miles per day. After they finished these few miles in the park it was almost 8:00 .We knew the park closed at 8:00. We were getting ready to leave when a very rude park ranger drove up. He immdiately assumed we were doing a fund raiser. We are doing a fund raiser for Parkinston disease but we were not doing it in that park the women were only running. He could have been more professional about the situation. After all we pay our state and federal taxes and are entitle to run in that park. I just hope that park ranger\'s family never gets this disease and has to deal with what my husband deals with every day of the week.

Mole acknowledged that he did plan to work with Mr. Stamm on Friday, September 3rd to refund the $20.00 transfer fee that  Mrs. Stamm?s family was charged, but after Mr. Stamm?s visit to the park office and abrupt departure, he was not given an opportunity to respond.  Given Mr. Stamm?s long history of service to JORD as a valued Park Volunteer, Supt. Mole was understandably concerned.  He made note of their conversation and the abusive language Mr. Stamm used, but had no further contact with Mr. Stamm.\r\n\r\nSupt. Mole checked CRS and verified that there are no future reservations for Crosswinds sites 60 & 61 through 2010.  Both sites have now been switched to accurately reflect their placement on the maps.  Supt. Mole has verified that to his knowledge, no further discrepancies with JORD campground maps exist.\r\n \r\nIn an effort to prevent this type of misunderstanding from re-occurring, I have asked Supt. Mole to reevaluate the JORD Volunteer Program and refrain from issuing vouchers for Free Camping for Special Events assistance.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that an error was made on DPR?s behalf and that a $20.00 Transfer Refund may be warranted.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nA.\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/RE_JORD_Crosswinds_Complaint_Reference_Mr._Daniel_Stamm_Sr._9.16.10.htm,file_upload/2010_09/D.Stamm.pdf,file_upload/2010_09/JORD_Crosswinds_Complaint_Reference_Mr._Daniel_Stamm_Sr._9.16.10.htm','','2010-09-30 12:27:21','Williams5894'),(1653,'Operations','2010-09-30','','CHOP','Terri Taylor','','CABE Wildlife Ramp Complaint: RE: WRC Ramp Closure During Prime Fishing Season 9.14.10','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/RE_WRC_Ramp_Closure_During_Prime_Fishing_Season_9.14.10.txt','','2010-09-30 12:27:12','Williams5894'),(1654,'Operations','2010-09-30','','Randy/Adrian','CHOP','','FOMA Subpoena','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/FW_Fort_Macon_Subpoena.htm,file_upload/2010_09/Subpoena-Matthew_Saathoff_(2).pdf','','2010-09-30 13:21:02','Williams5894'),(1655,'Operations','2010-09-30','','CHOP','CHOP','','LAJA Dedication of Paddy?s Creek Development and Paddy\'s Creek Public Water System correspondence','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/FW_LAJA_event.htm,file_upload/2010_09/laja_dedic_summary910.pdf,file_upload/2011_07/LAJA_Paddys_Crk_Public_Water_System_3-10-11.pdf','','2011-07-26 16:23:40','Williams5894'),(1656,'Operations','2010-09-30','','Angelia','CHOP','','JORD Poplar Point RE: Press Release Needed: Poplar Point Campground Closure  8.25.10 VJ Picotte complaint','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/RE_Press_Release_Needed_Poplar_Point_Campground_Closure__8.25.10.htm','1600','2010-10-01 16:08:05','Williams5894'),(1657,'Operations','2010-09-30','','MIKE','Tom Jackson','','RE: CHRO contract extension 8-9-10','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/RE_CHRO_contract_extension_8-9-10.htm,file_upload/2010_09/6100_FORM-2.xls','','2010-09-30 13:20:46','Williams5894'),(1658,'Operations','2010-09-30','','CHOP','MIKE e-response','','Gold Panning in State Parks','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/Gold_Panning_in_State_Parks.htm,file_upload/2010_09/15A_NCAC_12B_.0201.pdf','','2010-09-30 13:20:38','Williams5894'),(1659,'Operations','2010-09-30','','se','CHOP','','Support for Wake Audubon?s Young Naturalists.','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/FW_Letter_of_support.htm,file_upload/2010_09/Wake_Audubon_letter_of_Support.pdf,file_upload/2010_09/RE_Wake_Audubon_letter.txt','','2010-09-30 13:20:32','Williams5894'),(1660,'Operations','2010-09-30','','DIR','MIKE','','CHRO- Bob Wald','Lew,\r\n\r\nDraft appointment letter is attached.

As you know from our previous discussions the current GRMO office consists of a small room located within the Grandfather non profits maintenance shop. This location is not accessible to the public and does not provide sufficient work space for 3 employees or the storage of supplies and equipment. \r\n\r\nOn July 28th,  PASU McBean and I met with Penn Dameron the nonprofit director to discuss the office. Mr. Dameron stated he understood our need for a larger, publicly accessible office space. He restated the nonprofit governing board?s reluctance to allow our installing a modular office with utilities in the future area of the Learning Lodge. The board is concerned a modular office would be in the way of the Learning Lodge site clearing & construction. \r\n \r\nThe attached recommendation identifies an available retail space located within 3 miles of the Profile Trail Access. This Foscoe location is 15 minutes driving time from the Grandfather Nonprofit Office. Access to the GRMO trail heads on the parkway are accessible by the nearby Holloway Mountain Road. This road connects Hwy 105 and the parkway.  \r\n \r\nThe recommendation memo contains photos and specific information concerning the office space and the lease cost. I support PASU McBean\'s recommendation. \r\n \r\nThanks,\r\n \r\nTom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Jackson\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/GRMO_Interim_Park_Office_Recommendation.htm,file_upload/2010_09/GRMO_Park_Office_Recommendation_Memo__7-29-2010.docx,file_upload/2010_09/Recommendation_For_Lease_Of_GRMO_Office_Space_7-15-2010.htm,file_upload/2010_09/Current_GRMO_office_desk_space.jpg,file_upload/2010_09/Current_GRMO_office_storage.jpg,file_upload/2010_09/Current_GRMO_office.jpg,file_upload/2010_09/Exterior_view_of_proposed_GRMO_retail_space.jpg,file_upload/2010_09/Proposed_GRMO_retail_space_entrance_sign.jpg,file_upload/2010_09/GRMO_Park_Office_Recommendation_Memo__7-2010[1].docx,file_upload/2010_10/GRMO_Leased_Office_Memo10-12-2010.pdf','','2010-10-21 14:57:26','Williams5894'),(1664,'Operations','2010-09-30','','CHOP','','','ENRI Hessee Williams Property correspondence','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_09/FW_Questions_about_the_Hessee_Williams_property_at_ENRI.htm','','2010-10-21 14:57:44','Williams5894'),(1665,'Operations','2010-09-30','','CHOP','ANGELIA ALLCOX','','COMPLAINT: Information Needed on Procedures for Boat Rental Businesses @ JORD 7.14.10  Concessions','Don / Mike ?\r\n\r\nAttached please find complete history of Jordan Lake Water Sports contact @ Jordan Lake:\r\n\r\n1)	Letter from JORD Crosswinds Marina Lessee Albert Urquhart to CORPS Resource Manager Craig Shoe reference boats tours & boat rentals on Jordan Lake with his response dated June 18, 2010.\r\n\r\n2)	US Army Corps of Engineers Rules and Regulations governing public use of CORPS of Engineers Water Resources Development Projects.\r\n\r\n3)	Statement from JORD Ranger Brock Martin detailing incident that lead to the Citation of Jordan Lake Water Sport Owners Benjamin Davis & Bobby Roberts for violation of GS 113-35(a), 15A NCAC 12B .1101 Engaging in Commercial Enterprises in the park without a permit.

Thank you for building such a fantastic place for us to enjoy this great park.\r\n\r\nOur stay would have been much more pleasant if we were able to sleep better (because of the noise from the electric generator running all night at site #3 on Oct 22), and if we did not have to dodge the dogs running loose and barking during the day and night from site #12 on Oct 23 ). I also witnessed dogs loose on the trail (belonging to hikers) and saw one black lab chasing another riders horse at the intersection of Turkey Ridge trail and Little River trail on Oct 23. In addition, Coggins papers were not checked for my horses by anyone at the park, and none of the other horsemen I spoke with had their papers checked either. It is probable that you are allowing infected horses onto the facility.\r\n\r\nSouth Mountain is a fantastic facility, and foolish behavior by a few should not be allowed to diminish or ruin the stay of the majority. Please take the necessary steps to enforce the regulations concerning quiet time 10:00pm ? 8:00am and dogs on a leash no longer than 6 feet. I saw rangers in the Equestrian once daily during daylight hours only, and no ranger presence on the trails any of the 3 days.  \r\n\r\nI will forward this e-mail to all concerned so you can try to get the help needed to enforce existing regulations.\r\n\r\nMark Schlensker\r\n803-322-0525\r\nmarkschlensker@yahoo.com\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_10/FW_Park_Regulation_Enforcement.htm,file_upload/2010_11/FW_Park_Regulation_Enforcement.htm','','2010-12-21 14:56:58','Williams5894'),(1708,'Operations','2010-10-27','','Rosilyn','CHOP','','VACANCY TRACKER UPDATE WITH REDUCTIONS','Rosilyn,\r\n\r\nAttached is a spreadsheet showing positions that have been identified for either a 5%, 10% or 15% reduction.

She is currently recovering in a hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Crystal was hypothermic, but conscious and able to confirm her identity when searchers located her about a mile from where her vehicle had been parked on the Blue Ridge Parkway.\r\nCrystal had been last seen on Tuesday morning, October 26th, by her father at his office. Crystal?s vehicle was seen parked at Bullhead Mountain Overlook near Milepost 234 on the Blue Ridge Parkway on Wednesday morning around 8:00am. As this overlook provides parking for an area where visitors frequently hike and camp overnight, the vehicle?s registration was not immediately checked. Upon running the registration of the vehicle on Saturday morning, Blue Ridge Park Rangers discovered that the owner, Crystal Ham, was listed as missing by her family.\r\nOver the next three days, searchers and organizers from multiple cooperating agencies, including North Carolina State Parks, North Carolina Highway Patrol, Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smoky Mountain National Park, Laurel Springs, Cherry Lane, Glade Creek, Alleghany County Search and Rescue, Alleghany County Sheriff?s Department, Kershaw County, North Carolina Search and Rescue Dog Association, and North Carolina Project Saver Specialized Team searched a 1.25 mile radius from the location her vehicle was found. The search area was divided into segments, and those segments were prioritized and searched. Seven teams searched assigned areas on November 1st, some going out on multiple missions during the day as they searched the difficult terrain.\r\nOn the afternoon of November 1st, one of the search teams volunteered to search one last segment of the search area before dark. At 6:11pm, that search team located Crystal, alive but suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and exposure. The searchers began warming her, and her condition started to improve. Crystal was found on State Park land, approximately one mile downhill from where she had parked on the Parkway, in an area of steep terrain and tall trees, with the light quickly fading. At 9:45pm, a paramedic was able to hike in to her location and assess her condition, and determined that she was stable enough to stay the night. Due to the difficulty and risk associated with a helicopter rescue in steep terrain, a plan was developed to bring Crystal out of the area by helicopter at first light.\r\nThirteen searchers and rescuers spent the night with Crystal, keeping her warm and monitoring her condition. At approximately 8:30am, a helicopter from the North Carolina National Guard hoisted her out of the ravine she was in, along with one of the paramedics that had been treating her. She was then flown to a nearby landing zone near the Bluffs Lodge on the Blue Ridge Parkway where she was assessed by an ambulance crew before being transferred to a medical helicopter to be flown to Winston-Salem.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wxii12.com/video/25606040/detail.html\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Jackson\r\nWest District Superintendent\r\n','','','','','complete','','http://www.wxii12.com/video/25606040/detail.html,http://www.facebook.com/notes/nc-dept-of-environment-and-natural-resources/joint-efforts-of-state-parks-staff-national-park-service-and-rescue-agencies-res/453713688121','file_upload/2010_11/STMO_Search.pdf','','2010-12-01 12:41:18','Williams5894'),(1712,'Operations','2010-11-03','','Gray','CHOP','','STMO Complaint Erik Gray, 10/18/2010','','response mailed','11/2/2010','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_11/Complaint_STMO_Erik_Gray_10-25-10.pdf,file_upload/2010_11/E__Gray_STMO_Response_10-29-2010.doc','','2010-11-03 15:23:01','Williams5894'),(1713,'Operations','2010-12-17','','DISU\'s','CHOP','','Operating and Equipment Budgets 2010-2011 (COLLECTION OF CORRESPONDENCE REGARDING THE SUBJECT)','12/17/2010DISU?s,\r\n\r\nI had an opportunity to meet with Tony today regarding equipment budgets.  I wanted to get a handle on the current funding to determine the money available to purchase 800 MHz radios.  There is also a price difference in the truck order that can be covered from the additional operating funds that you were given for your district.  I checked operating budgets for some of the parks division-wide and we appear to be right on target with expenditures.  For now, we will increase the amount from the district operating budgets to $75,000 to move to equipment.  This will provide enough funding to cover the purchase of the crew cab trucks, hand-held 800 MHz radios and mobile 800 MHz radios.  This should also cover some of the additional items that have been added to the equipment database.\r\n\r\nThis will leave the following operating funds available in your district line item budget to allocate for operations.  EADI-$25,868, NODI-$139,390, SODI-$79,854, WEDI-$69,129.  As we move through the process we may be able to move additional funds over to cover equipment needs depending how individual park operating budgets are being managed.  You should be able to see the available funds after Tony moves the money into equipment.  \r\n\r\nAs Tammy has mentioned before, it?s very important to keep the budget database updated regularly.  This will ensure that we have an accurate view of equipment costs and order status to determine if additional funds are available for equipment needs.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or have additional equipment needs.  Thanks.    \r\n\r\nMichael D. Lambert\r\n\r\n12/16/2010 Hey Mike,\r\n \r\nBased on your memo below,  I  have transferred $75,000 from each of the 4 District Offices to fund your  Equipment needs. Each of the 4 Districts will see these monies transferred from their Operating Expenses Budget, Account# 533900.  \r\n \r\nTony\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nSome of you had asked if you could use the additional funds placed in your district operating budgets to cover additional equipment needs.  You can use those funds to cover equipment needs.  Submit those needs in the equipment request database and keep track of the additional funds used out of your operating allocation.  \r\n\r\nBryan, Jerry, Sean and Yancy; the same holds true for your operating budget allocation if you have equipment needs.  \r\n\r\nPlease have all equipment entered and approved by this Friday 11/5.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael D. Lambert\r\n\r\n10/18/2010 District Superintendents,\r\n\r\nOperating and Equipment budgets have been finalized.  In addition we have added funds to cover our new operations at CACR and GRMO.  Otherwise, each park will have the amount they spent last year showing-up in the current year budget in the database.  You will also notice funds being added to the district operations budget that can be distributed throughout your district where you have additional budget needs.  These funds are to cover our needs through the remainder of this budget year.  Some of you have been involved with the discussions regarding reductions anticipated for the 2011/2012 budget cycle.  Use these funds appropriately this year in anticipation of reductions that we may face next year.\r\n\r\nEquipment funds have also been allocated, so your parks can begin entering equipment requests for this year.  Our goal is to have all equipment paid for and purchase orders issued by the end of 2010.  Angelia, motor vehicle purchases need to take precedent over other equipment needs.  It is imperative that we meet this deadline for our truck and truck body purchases.  I ask that each of you prioritize your vehicle purchases and enter those items first.  It will require an expedited response from you to enter and approve the equipment requests from your district.  The total amount of equipment funds available for each district are as follows.  EADI-$192,650, NODI-$351,304, SODI-$305,976, WEDI-$283,311.  Keep in mind that some items purchased last year will be paid out of the 2010/2011 equipment budget so check the database to determine how much will be coming off the top of your allocation.\r\n\r\nI think it\'s important that each Superintendent delegate portions of the purchasing requirements to their staff.  One or two staff members cannot efficiently purchase equipment in the tight deadlines that we require.  Make sure that we follow the purchasing guidelines and check state term contract for needed items.  Joanne can assist with purchasing some of the larger items.  She has specifications for 4-wheelers and other items. Ask staff to work within her specifications for those items that she bulk purchases.  \r\n\r\nNon-district operations staff need to review and track your budgets on the database.  Your funds have been allocated for the year with changes from last year?s budget.\r\n\r\nTammy will be providing additional information and updated purchasing guidelines at a later date.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions or need additional information\r\n\r\n','12/8/2010 Tammy / Tony,\r\n\r\nMike wanted me to add some equipment items to the Equipment Request Database to have on there to document our needs and for him to consider for future approval once some of our equipment requests/approval funds settle out BUT since the database request function has been locked, I cannot add them.  Can one of you please add the following;\r\n\r\n1)	PACR Purchaser / Archdale\r\n(29) EF Johnson Portable 800Mhz radios; $2624.00 each – total of $76,096.00\r\nJustification: These radios will augment the Division’s existing VIPER radio inventory to 200 so that each Division officer would have one.  The Division’s Human Resources section advises there are 213 commissioned positions in the Division but that probably doesn’t account for recent vacancy cuts, etc.\r\n\r\n2)	PACR Purchaser / Archdale\r\n(15) EF Johnson Mobile 800Mhz radios & Power Supply for park offices; $2745.10 each – total of $41,176.50\r\nJustification:  These mobile radio base stations will be installed in park offices based on a priority basis of where the local emergency agencies have primarily gone to the VIPER system and can no longer communicate with the park’s current radio system.

These units provide criminal and other law enforcement data to Division officers in the field which is most important since the Division doesn’t have a dedicated dispatch system.  This would include MEMO, PETT, MEMI, DISW, GRMO.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBryan \r\n\r\n\r\n==============\r\nBryan Dowdy\r\nParks Chief Ranger\r\n','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_11/RE_Operating_and_Equipment_Budgets_.htm,file_upload/2010_12/Equipment_Request_Database_Additions.htm,file_upload/2010_12/RE_Equipments_order_which_may_exceed_budgeted_amounts.htm,file_upload/2010_12/Operating_Funds_moved_to_Equipment.htm,file_upload/2010_12/RE_Operating_Funds_moved_to_Equipment_FROM_T_BASS.htm','','2010-12-20 20:08:17','Williams5894'),(1714,'Operations','2010-11-03','','DISU\'s','CHOP','','Seasonal Funding January-June 2011','DISU?s,\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in our meeting yesterday the following seasonal funds are available for each district to allocate: \r\n\r\nEADI  (Appropriated)$208,022.00\r\nNODI (Appropriated)$558,825.00  (Receipted)$230,825.00\r\nSODI  (Appropriated)$422,343.00\r\nWEDI (Appropriated)$270,114.00\r\n\r\nAs you view each parks requested positions you should adjust at the district level or have the park review/cut the requested amounts.

On 10/25 , I spoke to KELA Superintendent Fleming concerning Mr. Alcon?s concerns: road condition, low hanging limbs in JC Cooper Campground and lack of water taps around campsites 56 to 59.  I conveyed to Mr. Alcon Superintendent Fleming has contacted DPR construction tech to schedule repairs through DOT to road pot holes and some shoulder improvement.  I told Mr. Alcon we would not be able to widen the road as that is a larger project than we can afford.  Superintendent Fleming prior to our conversations had requested Ranger A. Parten trim the roadway to prevent damage to RVs from low limbs.  I conveyed this information to Mr. Alcon.  I have also indicated to Superintendent Fleming Mr. Alcon was concerned about the entire roadway corridor needing trimming not just certain areas. We discussed the lack of water taps in the campground in the area of campsites 56 to 59.  I conveyed I have been told additional water spigots are not permitted in the area without additional sewer connections in the area.  This is not possible given the area is in the flood plain.  I assured Mr. Alcon I?ll look at the area with Superintendent Fleming to see what improvements we may be able to pursue.\r\n\r\nMr. Alcon was thankful for my calls and he indicated no further concerns.\r\n\r\nErik Nygard, NODI \r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_11/KELA_Alcon_Complaint_20101027.htm','','2010-11-17 03:28:38','Williams5894'),(1716,'Operations','2010-11-03','','DISU\'s','CHOP','','Annual Operations Report','Park Superintendents,\r\n\r\nThis e-mail is to introduce to you efforts made by Operations and Planning staff to improve and streamline the GMP process. This will allow greater input from the park superintendent and staff and will result in a newly updated annual operations plan to become the nucleus of the GMP process.  The process will require that each park complete a systematic, annual operations report at the end of each fiscal year that provides a summary of the park operations covering administration, operations, natural resources, protection and safety, interpretation and education including future goals and additional needs for each category. \r\n\r\nEach year vital park operations decisions and issues are not documented.  In past years, superintendents wrote an annual operations document known as the Superintendent?s Report.  The purpose was to detail park operations including activities and incidents that took place throughout the year.  I recently spoke with a long time Division Park Superintendent and they advised that they had reviewed past superintendent?s reports to obtain information for current park operations.  The value of this report is that it provided a detailed description of each individual park operation and could be used as a reference in subsequent years.  Again, this new plan will have a similar purpose but will become the basis for the GMP process.\r\n\r\nThe new plan will integrate information already collected for other annual plans such as, the Annual Interpretation and Education Plan, therefore creating the need for only one annual planning document.  Preparations for the work performance plan review will assist in creating this document. This will permit the GMP process to keep current operational information available on an annual basis.  The timeline to complete an annual GMP review every five years would remain in-place.  \r\n\r\nWith the additional workloads, the loss of positions and the turnover created by promotions and retirements each year, now more than ever it is vital to track park operations decisions and issues from the Superintendent and his/her staff?s perspective.\r\n\r\nI am asking each of you to complete the annual operations report for the 2009-2010 fiscal year.  Each park will gather their statistical information including budget, revenue, personnel, visitation and program numbers from existing databases.  This report will be written in a concise manner and submitted on-line. When completed it is intended to be no more than 5 or 6 total pages of printed material.  A paragraph format is recommended, however, it may be beneficial to include certain information in a bulleted format.  I encourage you to involve key staff members at your park in compiling your park?s report.  \r\n\r\nWhen completed, each Superintendent will submit the report for the District Superintendent?s review.  Our deadline for Submitting the 2009-2010 annual report is Friday, October 15.  Next year, the deadline will be September 15.   In time, you may find it beneficial to complete the report near the end of the work performance review cycle when most of the information is current.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Joe Shimel has developed an initial annual operations report for MOJE?s upcoming general management plan review. You will be able to see an example of the report on the DPR database. As we develop these plans we may need to refine the process to provide the most desired information.  Being able to utilize the report for an actual GMP this fall will provide valuable information.  As more reports are written for each park, the information will become an asset to the GMP process.\r\n\r\nThis report is not intended to create additional oversight or workloads but to keep current operational information available for planning and analysis centered on each parks? operational needs and public use.\r\n  \r\nIn addition, the report will become the basis from which to recognize the staff and park operation that goes above and beyond to exemplify the division?s mission. An award presented annually called Park of the Year has been developed.   The first award will be given at the Superintendent?s conference this year.  \r\n\r\nI am appreciative of the professionalism and dedication exhibited by our staff given the staff reductions and budget cuts during the 2009/2010 fiscal year.  I know it?s going to be extremely difficult to choose only one operation for an award when so many are deserving of recognition. \r\n\r\nInstructions for accessing the database are listed below.\r\n\r\nHow to get to the NC DPR Annual Operations Report\r\n-Go to Park Use link on the DPR Home Page\r\n-Select DPR Annual Operations Report from the drop down menu\r\n-Review Instructions-Blue Button\r\n-Submit a Report: enter Park Code\r\n-PASU: Enter Name\r\n-Enter a brief comment and data in each section and keep the information under 10 lines.\r\nExample: If you would like to see an example of required information and format go to the drop down menu under edit report and choose MOJE.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS DEADLINE for completing this report is OCTOBER 15, 2010\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about content please contact the District Superintendent.  \r\n\r\nAny questions related to form data entry or printing contact Tom Howard at 919-552-2976 or tom.howard@ncdenr.gov. \r\n\r\n\r\nMichael D.

I live in Ashe County and despite the fact that this is a rural county with lots of undeveloped land, there are extremely few public areas for hiking and picnicking. Most of the land here is private, and we are limited when it comes to experiencing our natural environment.  I understand that every one is having to cut back and some cuts are inevitable, but I can\'t see how closing this park will make a dent in the budget. This park can\'t possibly cost a lot to run, but maybe I\'m just naive. I don\'t see why you would need more than one person on call or on duty at a time. All we want is access to the beautiful trails and views that have already been created through lots of hard work.  Please try to find a way to keep this park open so that the people of Ashe County, and our visitors, have an opportunity to get outside, exercise, and see the spectacular views. \r\nThank you for your time,\r\nSincerely, \r\nBeth Sorrell\r\nWest Jefferson, NC \r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_12/FW_Mount_Jefferson_State_Park.htm','','2010-12-01 13:09:01','Williams5894'),(1752,'Operations','2010-12-01','','Mike','ANGELIA ALLCOX','','2011 DPR Vehicle Request - Master List 11.24.10','Adrian,\r\n\r\nPlease send Angelia additional information/justification about the plans we discussed on 11/23 to utilize the hybrid vehicles replacing MFM sedans in the EADI.

Play 60 Program (?) that was supposed to involve our Division in public service work with the Panthers and others and participating in a Color Guard / presentation of the US/State Flags at a Carolina Panthers football game this year.  Well, as you know that pretty much fell through but we continued on with our Color Guard Team development.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLaw Enforcement Specialist Phil King who had military experience prior to coming to the Division, took over the leadership role in developing & training the Color Guard Team.  Since we originally had only a short time to develop the team, we solicited/invited 5 rangers of about the same height and who we thought would take the team and its purpose seriously, to participate in this unit.  They all agreed and have since gotten together a few times to train on the basics of marching and military drill.  Their first event was the presentation at the Superintendents Conference.  It takes considerable amount of training and practice to be a polished Color Guard/Honor Guard Team and they will continue to train.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are in the process of purchasing several specialty uniform & equipment items for the team for their training and actual events.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are now soliciting volunteers towards developing a larger, full Honor Guard Team for the above events.  We would ultimately like to put together a 12-15 person team to be able to handle a worst case scenario of an employee?s funeral that might include church/funeral home duty, pall bearers, casket detail & flag folding/presentation to the deceased?s family, gun salute, traffic control, etc.  Development of such a team & its functions will again take additional training and dedication by the volunteers and is a work in progress.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Team is an all volunteer group and is open to all Division officers (male & female) who have at least one year of commissioned experience, have an exemplary work performance record, are height and weight proportionate, have a clean cut appearance (e.g. short hair and no facial hair during actual events) and who would represent the Team and Division well during such events.  A short application process including approvals from the supervisors, District Superintendent, Parks Chief Ranger and Chief of Operations is required before an employee is accepted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe current have Phil and the 5 rangers on the initial Color Guard Team now and have 3-4 additional rangers that have recently volunteered and been approved but have not yet participated in any training.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe team that was there at the Superintendent?s Conference were;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPhil King, LESP\r\n\r\nKevin Bischof, GOCR\r\n\r\nToby Hall, LAWA\r\n\r\nEd Wilkerson, MEMO\r\n\r\nLance Huss, SOMO\r\n\r\nRob Preston, JORD\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need further.\r\n\r\nBryan ','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_12/FW_Honor_Guard_@_Old_NC_Capitol.htm,file_upload/2010_12/Honor_Guard_12-4-10.jpg,file_upload/2010_12/Honor_Guard_Capitol_12-4-10.jpg,file_upload/2010_12/Honor_Guard-Presidents_Memorial_12-4-10.jpg,file_upload/2010_12/RE_Color_Guard.htm','','2010-12-21 15:01:24','Williams5894'),(1765,'Operations','2010-12-07','','CHOP','Paul Donnelly','','2011 Superintendent\'s Conference Dates','','pending additional correspondence but moved out of status location.dw 12/21/2010','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_12/RE_2011_Superintendents_Conference_Dates.htm','','2010-12-21 14:59:16','Williams5894'),(1766,'DEDE','2010-12-07','email','DEDE','D.

DWQ Point #1:   Vent / Drain Pipe: Park staff are in the process of purchasing the necessary screens and will have them installed next week.\r\n?	DWQ Point #2:   Ground Storage Tank Leak: CHRO MM IV Alvin Barnwell is researching concrete patch materials that are suitable for use with potable water.  If nothing can be found locally, we will purchase materials on-line and the repair will be made as soon as possible.\r\n?	DWQ Point #3:  Ground Storage Tank Age / Condition: This repair would hopefully be done as a capital project.  A similar project was recently completed at MOMI at a cost of over $440,000 and included a new pump station building, two pumps and three 7,000 gallon storage tanks. \r\n?	DWQ Point #4:  Chlorinator Location: This should be included as part of a capital project in conjunction with the tank renovations.  A flow switch will be installed at the storage tank building in order to prevent the chlorinator from dosing the tank if the well runs out of water for any reason. The switch has been ordered and should be installed within the month.  This should cover us until a major project can be completed.\r\n?	DWQ Point # 5:  Above Ground Water Lines:  This will be a capital project.  Design & Development staff have discussed running new water and sewer lines under the road when / if the park road is addressed. There are several thousand feet of exposed water line in the park.  A similar project is needed for the overhead power lines.\r\n?	DWQ Point #6:  Once work is completed on DWQ items # 1-2 and the flow switch installation portion of DWQ item # 4 is completed,  we will contact Mr. Black for a review of the repairs.\r\n?	Regarding your question concerning certified operators:  Adrienne & CRM have been in discussion concerning the CRP water system transitioning from private contractor James & James to CRM employees.  Two CRM staff have received the NC DWQ C-Well Operator License, as has CHRO MM IV Alvin Barnwell.   Alvin will be overseeing the work of the CRM staff and / or the private contractor. Adrienne is hesitant to place Alvin fully in charge of the system since we do not control the daily water system operations. \r\n\r\nIf you need additional information, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2010_12/FW_Public_Water_System_CHRO.htm,file_upload/2010_12/CHRO_drinking_water_violation_11-29-10.pdf,file_upload/2010_12/Public_Water_System_CHRO.htm','','2010-12-20 20:09:08','Williams5894'),(1770,'Administration','2010-12-08','','DIR','McNair','','Request to release vacant position LANO LEO (32870)','to McNair','','12/9/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-12-09 16:21:09','Eikinas5239'),(1771,'Administration','2010-12-08','','DIR','McNair','','Request to release vacant position GORG MMIV (65010034)','to McNair','','12/9/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-12-09 16:21:39','Eikinas5239'),(1772,'Administration','2010-12-08','','DIR','McNair','','Request for approval of secondary employment for Trostle (JORD)','to McNair','','12/9/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-12-09 16:21:59','Eikinas5239'),(1773,'Administration','2010-12-08','','DIR','McNair','','Recommendation for HR action GOCR PASU (32898)','to Lambert\r\n12/22/10 from Lambert','','','','','complete','','','','','2011-03-31 15:08:52','Eikinas5239'),(1774,'Administration','2010-12-06','','DIR','Lambert','','Seasonal position request January 1, 2011 - June 30, 2011 - Request to release 467 vacant positions ','to McNair','','12/9/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-12-09 16:36:33','Eikinas5239'),(1775,'Administration','2010-12-09','','DIR','McNair','','Recommendation for HR action JORD WWTO (33127)','to McNair','','12/9/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-12-09 17:18:15','Eikinas5239'),(1776,'Administration','2010-12-09','','DIR','McNair','','Recommendation for HR action for FALA LEO (33098)','to McNair','','12/9/10','','','complete','','','','','2010-12-09 17:18:35','Eikinas5239'),(1777,'Administration','2010-12-09','','DIR','Regier','','Request for appraisal - CHRO (Muth prop, 28.8 ac.)','to Tingley\r\n\r\n','Carol, Sue, Brian, I\'d like to know more about this need - given our increasingly limited funds.

In the event you need additional equipment please follow guidelines in Budget Forum# 70.\r\n \r\nExcerpt from Budget Forum# 70:\r\n \r\n12/16/10: (Equipment Budget Update) \r\nSince all Equipment Funds have been allocated for the Division, additional Park requests must be Approved by the District Superintendent. Because there are no more Equipment funds available, the DISU must choose 1 of the following 4 options before a New Equipment Request will be Approved for your Park:\r\n?  1)Your District Office may ask your PARK to reduce 1 or more Equipment Items from your Park\'s current \"Approved Equipment Budget\" \r\n?  2) Your District Office may cut 1 or more Items from other Parks in your District. \r\n?  3)Your District office may Approve a transfer of Money from your Park\'s Operating Expenses Budget. \r\n?  4)They can deny your request. \r\nThis decision will be left to the discretion of the District Office. Your District Office will need to notify Accounting Specialist (Bass) by Email of those New Items which need to be ADDED to the Database & the funding source. (either disapproving items on the current Approved List or requesting transfer of funds from your Operating Expenses Budget). \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: Luri needs 1 water heater at $300. The choices available to DISU Allcox are as follows:\r\n?  Option 1: DISU Allcox requires LURI to reduce by $300 the Approved Amount of an existing Approved Item from LURI\'s Approved Equipment Budget.\r\n?  Option 2: DISU Allcox requires another Park in the South District to reduce by $300 the Approved Amount of an existing Approved Item from the other Park\'s Approved Equipment Budget.\r\n?  Option 3: DISU Allcox requires LURI to use funds from LURI\'s Operating Expenses Budget to fund the New Equipment purchase. \r\nIf DISU Allcox decides on Option 3, she would send an Email to Accounting Specialist Bass as follows: \"I Approve the following Equipment Request for Luri: 1 Water Heater @ $300. Source of funding: Luri\'s Operating Expenses Budget\". Once Accounting Specialist Bass receives the Email request from DISU, the Budget Office will add the New Equipment Item to LURI\'s approved equipment list. Luri will also notice that their Operating Expenses Budget has been reduced by $300 (acct 533900-other supplies)\r\n \r\nNOTE: In the event that DISU Allcox wanted to reduce an existing Approved Equipment Item (Option 1 or 2), she would send an email as follows: \"I Approve the following Equipment Request for Luri: 1 Water Heater @ $300.

That means that we will need to come up with $759,508 from appropriations to cover our reversion.  It appears that a portion of the reversion can come from lapsed salaries of positions that are currently being held for the 5%, 10% and 15% cuts for next year.  The remaining funds will need to come from operating funds and equipment.  We?ll need to come up with a $200,000 reduction in equipment with the remaining amount of $196,495 being taken out of our operating budgets.  I will be looking at the current request for exemptions and work with Bryan and Angelia to trim our big ticket items.  You may need to make adjustments to your operating budgets after the $196,495 is transferred out of our division-wide operating budget.  \r\n\r\nTony and Tammy are working to re-establish the weekly approval database that we?ve used previously for all purchases.  Expect additional direction to come from them regarding the procedure.  I?m sure that it will be very similar to the same process that we had before that required all purchases to be approved by the division director.  Please follow Tammy?s direction from an earlier e-mail copied below.\r\n\r\nALL SPENDING FOR GOODS AND SERVICES IS TO STOP IMMEDIATELY UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.  (THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT OR MAJOR MAINTENACE FUNDS)\r\n\r\nALL TRAVEL IN WHICH EXPENSE TO THE STATE WILL BE INCURRED ( EXCEPT USE OF STATE CAR) MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.\r\n\r\nMore information will be coming out later today or first thing in the morning with more detailed information.  Please ensure that all staff who purchase or travel are aware of this email.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTammy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only travel allowed is to meet current job requirements.  All previously approved travel or training must be cancelled or re-submitted for approval.  We have some staff planning to travel out of state in the coming weeks.  I am currently checking on the status of those charges and will need to determine if the travel and training would be allowed, since portions of the classes may have already been paid for.  I have the original travel authorizations and will be working on approvals.  \r\n\r\nYou can read through the memos sent from the Office of State Budget and Management and Secretary Freeman.  Please note that these are strict guidelines that must be followed.  I will send additional information when available.

The management agreement requires CRM LLC to submit an operating plan annually for the new calendar year by December 31st. The division is required to approve the final version of the plan by February 15th of the new calendar year. \r\n\r\nThe attachments include:\r\n•	PASU Wallace Memorandum noting significant points within the CRM 2011 Operating Plan.\r\n•	CRM LLC 2011 Operating Plan\r\n•	CRM Manager Mary Jaeger Gale June 14, 2010 correspondence with Director Ledford.\r\n•	CRM Manager Mary Jaeger Gale November 30, 2010 e-mail correspondence with WEDI DISU concerning the operations plan.\r\n\r\nAdrienne’s e mail contains important operations section concerns.\r\n\r\nReview of the plan typically involves the Chief of Operations, Concessions Manager and Deputy Director.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom\r\n','4/14/2011 Tom,\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the memo submitted by Adrienne I had a few questions before sending a response.  As I understand, the Old Rock Caf? roof has been replaced along with awnings.  Part of the 2011 goals were to also paint the exterior.  Has that been completed?\r\n\r\nThe high priority request to repair the upper septic system was identified as a need for Adrienne and CRM LLC.  Please provide me  background work that has been done by park staff.  Is there a repair area near the top to add on to the lines?  What is the feasibility of installing a pump and haul toilet system to serve the cliff dwellers area and continue to utilize the septic system to service the sky lounge.  I know that considerations were discussed to tie-on the local water and sewer system.  \r\n\r\nFor the closed outcroppings features, is there a priority order for the repairs.  CRM LLC mentions on page 11 2011 goals that includes the annual maintenance of the outcroppings.  Is this the area that Adrienne is referring to in her memorandum?  This appears to be the only reference to these trail structures?  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael D.

Specifically, he stated that he gave information to Seasonal GUW Donnie Williams about some individuals who frequently have their dog off a leash.  He is upset that we haven\'t done anything about it.   He also asked for name, address and phone number for the NC State Parks Director (which I provided; the phone number I gave is the 919-733-4181 number).\r\n \r\nI was able to get from him specific information from him on the vehicle, where they normally park, a general description of the hikers and the dogs, and which trails they normally hike.  We are investigating the situation as I write, and Kelly Cooke and I were not aware of this situation before Mr. Sims told us about it.  GUW Donnie Williams states that Mr. Sims gave him the information about 6 months ago, and Donnie put it on the Visitor Center reception desk.\r\n \r\nThe discussion between Ranger Kelly Cooke, Mr. Sims and I was long and detailed.  Please contact me if you need any further specifics on the conversation.

This practice is not sustainable at any park, and especially as we enter the visitor season with longer operating hours. We had held out the hope that the pending LANO and MOMI ranger recommendations would be approved this winter, but as we enter the second week of February, we can no longer wait to start making plans for this spring.\r\n\r\nYesterday I composed a memo explaining our situation and providing direction for specific parks to work together in providing staffing to cover park operations beginning April 1st .  Mike Lambert requested that I not send the memo out to you all until he can share it with Director Ledford.  Mike views our staffing and park operational challenges not just as a district problem, but as an issue for the whole  division.  His support, and any division assistance he can provide will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nEven though we cannot formally plan staffing assistance until we receive approval, I wanted to give you a heads up prior to our Feb 28th meeting.  Please share with your staff the difficulties we?re facing and the probability of staff deployments within the district beginning in April, and keep this in mind as you develop the April work schedules. I know there will be questions, so don?t hesitate to contact me to discuss them. After our Feb. 28th meeting, I will be available to meet with your staff if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom         \r\n','','','','','complete','','','','','2011-03-22 13:14:01','Williams5894'),(1945,'Operations','2011-02-08','','CHOP','statewide','','CRMO Worker\'s Comp Issues Statewide for HR meeting per CHOP request','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_02/Worker_Comp.docx,file_upload/2011_02/FW_Workers_Comp_Problems.htm','','2011-03-22 13:13:54','Williams5894'),(1946,'Operations','2011-02-08','','CHOP','Tom Jackson','','GRMO - BATS-USFWS Courtesy contact Concerning White-Nose Syndrome ','Mike,\r\nSue is working with Charlie and Marshall on this.

A motorcycle wrecked on stony ridge road, after descending the hill and skidding around 100 feet, stopping about 75 feet before the corridor trail crosses the road. A trail marathon SPAC event was occurring at the same time on the corridor trail.  I responded from the river section and assisted the fire department with directing traffic. After I arrived the individual was already in a ambulance. I was told he was fine other than abrasions and possibly a hurt knee.  I stayed on the scene and helped direct traffic until SHP arrived and investigated the accident, at which point I left as the mountain was already full with traffic.  \r\n\r\nI got a call from the man on the motorcycle?s wife today wanting to know ?what I?m going to do about her medical bills? ?that my event didn?t have any traffic control? and that there were ?kids running across the road and she was worried about the kids?\r\n\r\nI am still waiting to hear back from SHP and a potential witness to the accident. Regardless, this area was signed as ?Horse Crossing? by DOT at my request. I asked them to stripe it as a crosswalk and they stated it did not meet the criteria for a crosswalk since it is a lightly traveled rural road.  Any horse, walker, or runner would have the expectation as a pedestrian that a vehicle would be able to reduce speed to avoid an accident if they were crossing the road, and that a pedestrian would have the right of way. I have not called this lady back and I won?t be until I hear from SHP as to their determination of what caused the accident.\r\n\r\nJust letting you know ahead of time in case the lady was to contact you. Her name is Sharon Hayes.

I challenged all of you to increase your program numbers and insisted that it be with high quality programs and you have all hit the mark.  Our numbers continue to improve both in programs offered and number of participants. This is outstanding, but what makes it even more impressive is variety of programming that has been offered throughout the district.  You all participated in a great number of outreach activities to schools and special events.  This is not all though, this year we have had even more park visitors attending in-park programs. This shows that State Parks offers one of the best opportunities for safe, fun, family oriented recreation and education not only in eastern North Carolina but throughout the state. \r\n\r\n            You have continually improved year after year in this area, but for the 2010/2011 work year you have almost doubled the number of programs offered from the previous year?s period.   This increase in the number of programs given has also resulted in an increase in the number of people attending by over 30,000. Our district wide totals for this past work year were 8,749 programs offered throughout all eight of our East District State Parks with a program attendance of 185, 417 persons. That truly shows the impact you have on the park visitors in our district. \r\n\r\n            This accomplishment is a product of all staff from the seasonal to the Superintendent.  It shows great team effort and cooperation.  Please share this with any of your staff that may not be reached by this e-mail.  I hope you all will take great pride in what you have accomplished and the service that you have extended to the public through these educational encounters.  Once again, thank you for all of your efforts and hard work and let?s strive to make this coming work year even more successful.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAdrian \r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/I_E_Figures_for_this_year.htm','','2011-05-17 11:33:14','Williams5894'),(2146,'Operations','2011-05-17','','DIR','CHOP','','Swimming in tannin-stained water','Lew,\r\n\r\nI did not contact the Division of Water Quality to discuss their specific requirements for swim areas.  I can do that if  necessary.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina public swimming areas are monitored by local health departments or the Division of Water Quality that primarily focuses testing on excessive levels of bacteria that could result in a human illness.  One of our more popular state recreation areas near Raleigh experienced periodic closures over the past couple of years due to excessive amounts of the bacteria Enterococcus.  These closures were limited and follow-up testing normally yielded negative results for the bacteria.  Regardless, the closures made it more difficult to operate facilities and public concerns mounted with media coverage.\r\n\r\nI was able to follow-up with some of our park staff that operate lake based swim areas as well as a traditional swimming pool facility and neither one is required to test for tannin staining.  Routine testing is performed for bacteria.  There is not a legal or recommended acceptable level of tannin staining or water clarity that has been communicated to our staff.  In many cases health departments or the Division of Water Quality performs testing independently without contacting our staff.  Park staff perform Secchi disk testing as part of environmental education programming and say that it is very rare to have clarity with the 4? Secchi disk test.  Occasionally during drought conditions tannin levels drop and the water clears.  \r\n\r\nOur state park pool operator stated that tannin staining in pool water is common.  Proper chlorination and filtering removes the tannin.  Our clarity requirements are to be able to see the main drain or bottom of the pool.  \r\n \r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/RE_swimming_in_tannin-stained_water.htm','','2011-05-17 11:30:38','Williams5894'),(2147,'Operations','2011-05-17','','ALL STAFF','MIKE','','NC People with Lewis Ledford-  you can watch the show just click on link','','','','','','complete','','http://video.unctv.org/video/1923127314','','','2011-05-17 11:33:04','Williams5894'),(2149,'Operations','2011-05-17','','ALL STAFF','MIKE','','DIRECTOR AND NC PEOPLE INTERVIEW','','','','','','complete','','http://video.unctv.org/video/1923127314','','','2011-06-23 15:45:11','Williams5894'),(2150,'APC','2011-04-25','','STWD OA\'s APC Council','on behalf of APC','','ADMINISTRATIVE PROFESSIONAL\'S DAY 2011 CARD ','STATE PINS, APC-CLIP OR PIN W/CASH-PENDING RECEIPT OF INTEROFFICE MAIL RETURN FOR YORK FROM MSC-USPS.','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/card1.pdf','','2012-01-03 15:10:17','Quinn0398'),(2151,'APC','2011-04-18','','DENISE','Julie Bunn','','ANNUAL REPORT DESCRIPTION OF OFFICE ASSISTANTS & APC WITH PHOTOS FOR 2011-12 ANNUAL REPORT','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/Office_Assistants_are_Multifaceted_Professionals.doc,file_upload/2012_01/APC_A_Brief_History.pdf','','2012-01-06 16:03:21','Quinn0398'),(2152,'APC','2011-05-17','','COUNCIL MEMBERS','','','APC LOGO FILE 23 KB JPG','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_01/APC_Final_adobepsp.jpg,file_upload/2012_01/APC_Final_print_shop_grouped_small.jpg,file_upload/2012_01/logo_word_doc.doc,file_upload/2012_01/APC_Final_print_shop_grouped.jpg,file_upload/2012_01/APC_Final_adobepsp_copy.gif,file_upload/2012_01/APC_Final_print_shop_grouped_sm.pdf','','2012-01-12 16:32:53','Quinn0398'),(2153,'OPAA','2011-05-17','','CHOP & Angelia','Eric Winchester','','COMPLAINT- JORD CROSSWINDS MARINA','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/COMPLAINT_Crosswinds_Marina_Concession_5.16.11.htm,file_upload/2011_05/Letter_about_Crosswinds_Marina.docx','','2017-08-02 16:51:02','Williams5894'),(2154,'OPAA','2011-05-17','','','Erik Nygard','','COMPLAINT FALA -UNABLE TO READ SIGNATURE- NO RETURN ADDRESS OR NAME','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/NODI-_FALA_Complaint_recvd_5-5-2011.pdf','','2011-05-17 19:24:12','Williams5894'),(2373,'Administration','2012-01-11','','DIR','Howerton','','New trail construction approval form NERI','to Howerton','','','','','complete','','','','','2013-04-30 13:06:22','Eikinas5239'),(2374,'Administration','2012-01-11','','DIR','Howerton','','New trail construction approval for LAJA (ADA access to pier)','to Howerton','','','','','complete','','','','','2013-04-30 13:05:49','Eikinas5239'),(2156,'Operations','2011-05-17','','MIKE','','','HARI OP RESERVE CHURCH STREET SECTION INTERIM DEVELOPMENT MINIMUM STAFFING-CONTINUATION BUDGET ','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/HARI_Church_Street_Section_Interim_Development_Minimum_Staffing.xls','','2011-06-23 15:45:41','Williams5894'),(2157,'Operations','2011-05-17','','CHOP','Mike Lambert','','DERI OP RESERVE JUSTICE TRACT PROJECT FINAL','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/DERI_Oper_Resv_Justice_Tract_Project_Final.xls,file_upload/2011_05/DERI_Oper_Resv_Justice_Tract_Project_Final_REVISED.xls','','2011-06-23 15:45:20','Williams5894'),(2158,'Operations','0000-00-00','','CHOP','Mike Lambert','','MOMO OP RESERVE REQUEST MT OVERLOOK TOILET BLDG REPLACEMENT FINAL','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/MOMO_Oper_Resv_Request__Mt_Overlook_Toilet_Bldg_Replacement_Final.xls','','2011-06-23 15:46:01','Williams5894'),(2159,'Operations','2011-05-18','','CHOP','Max Rogers','','GMP GOALS FOR 2011','Hello all,\r\n\r\nThis email is to follow up on our meeting this afternoon.  For those who were unable to attend, here?s what we discussed:\r\n\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nIn late 2010 the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation reconfigured the General Management Plan (GMP) process and document format.  In early 2011, this new format was successfully implemented at MOJE and HARO.  We are now ready to implement this new GMP format across all park units.\r\n\r\nFor now, our focus will be state parks and state recreation areas.  However, the state lakes and state natural areas which have historically been included in the GMP process will continue to do so.  These park units are:\r\n\r\nBATR, CABE, CACR, CHRO, CLNE, CRMO, DISW, ELKN, ENRI, FALA, FOFI, FOMA, GOCR, GORG, GRMO, HABE, HARO, HARI, JORI, JORD, JONE, KELA, LAJA, LOHA, LANO, LAWA, LURI, MARI, MEMO, MEMI, MOJE, MOMO, MOMI, NERI, OCMO, PETT, PIMO, RARO, SILA, SOMO, STMO, WEWO, WHLA, and WIUM. \r\n\r\nWe have two goals for GMPs in 2011.  Each program head is responsible for:\r\n\r\n1.	Updating the data chapters for each of the above-listed units using the new GMP format.  I have created file folders on my computer to keep those data chapters as you digitally submit them.\r\n\r\n2.	Conducting a ?quick and dirty? assessment of the planning needs for each park as it relates to your program.  (i.e. trail planning needs at ENRI is high; trail planning needs at WHLA is very low.)  This will be helpful in setting future GMP schedules in 2012 and beyond.\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you complete these assignments by Friday, December 30, 2011.  If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMax Rogers, AICP\r\nState Parks Planner\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/RE_GMP_Goals_for_2011.htm','2174','2011-06-23 15:47:59','Williams5894'),(2160,'Operations','2011-05-18','','CHOP','ANGELIA ALLCOX','','COMPLAINT: JORD Crosswinds Marina Concession 5.16.11','Don ? \r\n\r\nAttached please find a Letter from Mr. Eric Winchester referencing his visit to Crosswinds Marina, with his family, on Friday - April 22, 2011.\r\n\r\nMr. Winchester has asked that this correspondence be forwarded to the Division of Parks and Recreation Management in an effort to share his dissatisfaction with the quality of service he received while visiting a state park leased facility.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAngelia\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nMr. Winchester - \r\n \r\nI have received your letter and I will forward a copy to our NC State Parks Concessions Manager.\r\n \r\nThank you for your time and comments on the operation of the Crosswinds Marina at Jordan Lake State Recreation Area.\r\n \r\nWe appreciate your feedback as we strive to provide a quality experience at all of our recreational facilities.\r\n \r\nPlease let me know if we can be of further service to you and your family.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nAngelia Allcox, South District Superintendent\r\nNC Division of Parks and Recreation\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Eric Winchester [mailto:ewinchegti@yahoo.com] \r\nSent: Monday, May 16, 2011 8:31 AM\r\nTo: Allcox, Angelia\r\nSubject: Crosswinds Marina\r\n\r\nAngelia,\r\n \r\nI am sorry is has taken a couple of weeks to pen this letter down, but I wanted to express it in an exact manner by confirming with my wife each detail and making sure we felt the same about each stated comment.\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this email so I know that I entered your email correctly into my address book.

Your e-mail to Angelia Allcox, south district superintendent, was referred to me for response and consideration. We sincerely regret that you found the service and facilities unsatisfactory. We take visitor suggestions and concerns seriously.   \r\n            As you may know, the marina at Jordan Lake is operated as a concession by private operator through a contract with the state. However, the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation fully expects its staff and our agents, such as the marina operator, to be courteous, helpful and professional when dealing with the visiting public. I understand your desire to remain anonymous to the marina operator and will respect your wishes. \r\n            The marina contract is due to expire next spring and the next facility operator will be determined within the next few months. I will include your letter in our files for consideration as part of the contract bid and review process. We will also continue to monitor closely any other visitor concerns and complaints about the operation as we move forward. \r\nI apologize for your unpleasant experience. We strive to provide exceptional service to all of our visitors.  We always appreciate receiving feedback from visitors so we can continue to improve our services to the public.

Tom and I have asked Matt and the other climbing parks to provide us options for managing climbing.  Matt , having worked at JORI, has seen hang gliding recreational activity being well managed through a concession.  I have told him to look for other states and places where it is managed similarly.  I have discussed with Matt that I am not in favor of a concession as this recreational activity is something available to more people, in more places and what a concession would end up doing would provide exclusivity to one outfitter.  I indicated I am more in favor of an approach where the staff manages the area with limited permits per day and an eleven month park technician manages the climbing area.  Enforcement would be done by rangers upon reports from the park technician.\r\n\r\nSo no I?m not in favor but I wanted him to have a chance to look at all options.  I have stressed we need to be consistent across the climbing parks in management and that it would mean change for all.  \r\n\r\nErik, NODI\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_05/RE_PIMO_rock-climbing_2011_SOW_DRAFT.htm,file_upload/2011_05/PIMO_rockclimbing_2011_SOW_DRAFT.doc','','2011-06-23 15:44:39','Williams5894'),(2166,'Operations','2011-06-07','','CHOP','DENISE','','SEASONAL RVP_11-555 JULY 1-DEC 31, 2012 APPROVED SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS AND CORRESPONDENCE','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_06/RVP11.555.PDF,file_upload/2011_06/RVP_FINAL_DIR_Signed_5-16-2011_.pdf,file_upload/2011_06/RVP_Spreadsheet_final_7-1-2011-12-31-2011_5-16-dw.xls,file_upload/2011_06/RVP_Request_71-12312011_Final_authorization_signature_page_DIR_Signed_Memo_and_position_report_and_the_OSBM_required_excel_spreadsheet_attachment.htm','2170,2167','2011-08-01 15:24:25','Williams5894'),(2167,'Operations','2011-06-01','','CHOP','DENISE','','SEASONAL RVP_11-503 (4)LAJA LIFEGUARDS, RVP_11-502(1)CHIEF LIFEGUARD, RVP_501-REF STAND/BH FEE COLLECTOR, RVP_11-500(1)REF STAND/BATHOUSE MGR','SEE ATTACHED RVPS','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_06/SEASONAL_RVP_500_501_502_503_2011.pdf,file_upload/2011_06/RE_LAJA_Approved_positions_RVP_11-503_500501_502_added_to_current(11-63011)_HR_seasonal_database_and_the_next(71-12312011)position_request_database.htm','2166,2170','2011-06-23 15:50:19','Williams5894'),(2168,'Operations','2011-06-06','','CHOP','Denise','','SEASONAL RVP_2011-314  ','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_06/2-7-2010_RVP_all_positions_Signature_Page_Final.doc,file_upload/2011_06/Seasonal_Totals-CHOP_Rpt__12-7-2010__...pdf,file_upload/2011_06/OSBM_Spreadsheet_Final_12-7-2010.xls','','2011-08-01 15:24:39','Williams5894'),(2169,'OPAA','2011-06-10','','','DENISE','','APPROVED RVP2011-555 FOR JULY 1-DECEMBER 31, 2011 FORMS AND CORRESPONDENCE ','','6/9/2011-skipped line on park attendant tab of excel spreadsheet attachment, the position # was attached to the signed/approved RE and attachment.

EMEMO DATED 2/7/2011 WEDI','DISU?s,\r\nMike spoke with Lewis this morning concerning the attached memorandum. Lewis suggested a one page memo be drafted from him to Manly Wilder concerning urgent staffing issues at our parks.\r\n\r\nPlease send me information on any of your parks that have an urgent need to fill vacant positions such as was illustrated in the memo. \r\n?	Include the impacts on park operations as the operating hours and visitation increases. \r\n?	Include impacts on the public and park staff. \r\n?	Include the length of time (date) the position has been vacant  & the date a recommendation was submitted.  This should be on the tracker.\r\n?	Do not include vacancies that while important, they are not absolutely necessary to carry out park operations. For example, LANO has 2 of the 3 ranger positions vacant. We can get by if we could fill at least one of those positions.\r\n\r\nMy impression is we have not filled a ranger vacancy since May 2010. Let me know if that is correct for your district.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nTom\r\n\r\nFrom: Jackson, Tom \r\nSent: Tuesday, February 08, 2011 12:02 PM\r\nTo: Bradley, Jack; Bunn, Julie; Farr, Edward; Griffith, Jonathan; Hyde, Larry; Jackson, Tom; Ledgerwood, James; Mcbean, Susan; Mcelhone, Sean; Pagano, Steve; Rhinehart, Casey; Shimel, Joseph; Trivette, Larry; Wallace, Adrienne\r\nCc: Lambert, Mike; Williams, Denise\r\nSubject: WEDI Staffing Assistance\r\n\r\nSuperintendents,\r\n\r\nAs you know, ELKN, GORG, LANO and MOMI currently have only the PASU and one ranger to carry out ranger oriented park operations, including the daily park closing. This practice is not sustainable at any park, and especially as we enter the visitor season with longer operating hours. We had held out the hope that the pending LANO and MOMI ranger recommendations would be approved this winter, but as we enter the second week of February, we can no longer wait to start making plans for this spring.\r\n\r\nYesterday I composed a memo explaining our situation and providing direction for specific parks to work together in providing staffing to cover park operations beginning April 1st .  Mike Lambert requested that I not send the memo out to you all until he can share it with Director Ledford.  Mike views our staffing and park operational challenges not just as a district problem, but as an issue for the whole  division.  His support, and any division assistance he can provide will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nEven though we cannot formally plan staffing assistance until we receive approval, I wanted to give you a heads up prior to our Feb 28th meeting.  Please share with your staff the difficulties we?re facing and the probability of staff deployments within the district beginning in April, and keep this in mind as you develop the April work schedules. I know there will be questions, so don?t hesitate to contact me to discuss them. After our Feb. 28th meeting, I will be available to meet with your staff if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom         \r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_06/WEDI_Park_Operations-Assistance_2-7-2011_2.docx,file_upload/2011_06/Urgent_Park_Staffing_Issues_In_Your_District_.htm','','2011-06-23 15:44:02','Williams5894'),(2176,'Administration','2011-06-21','','DIR','Lambert','','Request for approval for secondary employment for Justin Barnes, JORI','to McNair','','6/21/11','','','complete','','','','','2011-06-21 19:07:49','Eikinas5239'),(2177,'Administration','2011-06-21','','DIR','','','Award for professional LE certificate for Phil King and Jamie Anderson.','to Dowdy','','6/21/11','','','complete','','','','','2011-06-21 19:09:15','Eikinas5239'),(2178,'Administration','2011-06-21','','DIR','Lambert','','Travel authorization for LE staff and instructors for ALERT, 1/9 - 3/22/12, Salemburg, $24,110.','','','','','','complete','','','','','2013-03-20 13:39:40','Eikinas5239'),(2179,'Administration','2011-06-21','','DIR','Lambert','','Travel authorization for Brittany Whitaker and Alshae Logan, Outdoor Nation Youth Summit, Atlanta, GA, 7/8-10/11, $0','to Dodd','','6/21/11','','','complete','','','','','2011-09-28 18:49:36','Eikinas5239'),(2180,'Operations','2011-06-23','','CHOP','Erik Nygard','','COMPLAINT: FALA  HYDOCK','DRAFT WORD DOC','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_06/Edit_response_Hydock__FALA.doc,file_upload/2011_06/FW_FALA_HYDOCK_COMPLAINT.htm','','2011-08-01 15:23:54','Williams5894'),(2181,'Operations','2011-06-23','','CHOP','CHARLIE PEEK','','STORY FOR UPCLOSE- DPR STAFF IN THE MILITARY','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_06/FW_story_for_UpClose.htm,file_upload/2011_06/Military_Veterans_Working_for_DENR_Responses.doc,file_upload/2011_06/Mike_I_have_started_a_.doc_list_of_what_we_have_so_far...waiting_for_WEDI.htm','','2011-08-01 15:23:45','Williams5894'),(2182,'Operations','2011-06-23','','','Carol Tingley','','POSITION REDUCTION FINAL FROM CAROL T','WIUM IS A RECEIPTED POSITION AND WAS EXCHANGED FOR A POSITION AT CLNE?

I have taken pictures of every side of every building with extra pictures of major problem areas.  I have pictures of the exposed major damage areas as well as the completed work on each building.  I have hundreds of pictures of both our construction team as well as the hundreds of volunteers (dozens of volunteer groups), and will have pictures of every building when we are done.  I feel that this is important to document as it shows the buildings in their current state as of a more recent date.  \r\n \r\nWhy did we undertake this project?  As leadership of the Umstead 100 Mile Endurance Run and runners who use the facilities in this park, we feel a sense of responsibility to take part in its care.  When Dale Tiska, one of our Umstead 100 runners and Outreach Coordinator for the Raleigh REI Store, talked to Blake Norwood and I about the possibility of pursuing a grant from REI to do some repairs on the buildings we had no idea how large the scope of this project would become, how much it would cost to do it, or how long it would take.  So Blake and I began a survey of every building in the Group Camps.  We measured key buildings to determine the square footage of each building, estimated the number of bad siding boards, columns and beams that might have to be replaced for each building and I then compiled this into a spreadsheet.  \r\n \r\nJean Spooner was then able to get materials costs for lumber and stain that was used to generate the initial REI Grant Proposal.  \r\n \r\nWhile this process was taking place, we began to look for volunteers to begin the work should grant be awarded.  Blake Norwood and Jerry Dudeck, two Professional Engineers who were just retiring from the DOT, and who are key Umstead 100 staff, Blake as the Race Director and Jerry as one of our Aid Station Captains, volunteered to help.  Both have extensive building backgrounds so our base team was in place.  \r\n \r\nAs it became more likely that we would be receiving a grant, we began to pursue additional volunteers.  Most of the staff we were able to recruit were our Umstead 100 runners, dedicated outdoor people like Mike McKinney (on the board of the Umstead Coalition) and a few other folks who were retired. \r\n \r\nI look forward to building a complete history of this project as it will tell future generations how the park came into its second life for them to use.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\n \r\nJoe Lugiano\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_07/Re_REI_Project_Update_-_June_28th_2011.htm','','2011-08-01 15:23:16','Williams5894'),(2188,'Operations','2011-07-05','','CHOP','Lewis Ledford','','BUDGET REDUCTION AND IMPACTS','Parks Staff and Friends ...\r\nAs we all know, these are challenging fiscal times.  The funding provided to agencies in the recently approved biennial budget has notable reductions.  This is to provide you an overview and update to make sure that everyone has the same information to share when questions are asked regarding parks.\r\nThe reductions to the State Parks System included the specific loss of 18  full-time permanent positions, including park rangers, maintenance mechanics, and other positions.  The legislation allows for the reductions to be being taken from vacant positions; positions that were vacant due to the recurring and prolonged hiring freezes.   The total reductions in appropriations for parks is 24.9%; however, a temporary reallocation of $6 million from the trust fund for operations provides for a net reduction this year of 5.6%.  In addition to the full time positions the reductions will also reduce funds for seasonal employees, utilities, supplies, gasoline and equipment.  The reduction in funds will affect the division?s ability to provide adequate management and stewardship of the park system?s 215,000 acres and to provide services to over 14 million annual park visitors.  The division may need to scale back programs and services and may need to postpone maintenance and custodial actions.\r\nIn addition to the $6 million for park operations, another $8,435,000 will also transferred this year from the Parks and Recreation Trust Fund to the General Fund to help address the overall shortfall.  \r\nTransfers from the Parks and Recreation Trust Fund will leave limited funding for the local parks grant program, and to repay indebtedness for bonds that previously paid for important land purchases at Lake James, Haw River, Chimney Rock, Grandfather Mountain and other state parks.  There will be little or no new funding available for new land acquisition or capital improvement projects.  These will need to be deferred until the state?s financial situation improves.  Though some reallocations were made, we remain very pleased that support exists to keep the North Carolina Parks and Recreation and Trust Fund legislation in place, as there were distinct efforts to redirect these funds by other interest groups for their specific causes.\r\nAgain, the transfer of the $6 million in funding from the Parks and Recreation Trust Fund to the park system?s operating budget is intended to be temporary and to prevent the complete closure of Mount Jefferson, Singletary Lake, or any other state parks.  We hope to avoid even partial closures, but if hiring freezes and budget shortfalls continue, the parks system may need to implement partial, temporary closures of facilities if staff members are not available to operate them.\r\nOur commitment has to protect permanent staff and to continue to meet our mission and providing conservation and quality outdoor recreation experiences.  We are appreciative of the continued support we\'ve received at multiple levels.  Thank you for your work and advocacy.  I welcome your questions or any comments.\r\nLewis\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_07/Budget_Reduction__Impacts.htm','','2011-08-01 15:23:06','Williams5894'),(2189,'Operations','2011-07-06','','CHOP','Mark EYRE','','CABE Complaint from Mark Eyre','','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_07/FW_Harassed_and_goaded_by_state_employee.htm','','2011-08-01 15:22:35','Williams5894'),(2190,'Operations','2011-07-06','','CHOP','Erik Nygard','','HARI Compliment from SAM Landes','Mr. Landes,\r\n\r\nThank you for the e-mail describing your experience at Haw River State Park.

I am writing you to congratulate you on how well the park is run.  From the moment my wife and I walked in, your Front Desk staff (Rhonda and Janette) were courteous, professional and very helpful.  Throughout the weekend they consistently collaborated with us in taking care of our conference needs (climate control, recreational facilities, housing and AV assistance).  They are hard working and friendly.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen staff bent over backwards to accommodate the many dietary needs of our diverse group.  Ed and Betty provided tasty, healthy and filling food every day and night.  We had a few people\'s birthdays fall on the weekend and the kitchen made a delicious and decorated birthday cake.  (Three in fact as we needed a vegan cake and a gluten free cake also)  The serving and cleanup kitchen staff (Josh and Ashley) always greeted us with a smile and a healthy portion of food.  They reflect well upon the North Carolina Park system.\r\n\r\nOf course, behind the well running organization is a strong and confident leader.  Kelley, the park superintendent was a visible and reassuring presence during the entire weekend.  We could tell that she had an attention for detail and a sound and equitable working relationship with her staff.  We felt that she was quite approachable with any questions we might have had.\r\nThe commitment to the environment evidenced by the recycling, electric carts and energy efficient lighting is a strong selling point for your park system\r\n\r\nThe grounds and facilities (gym, pool and canoeing) are an added plus to Haw River.  We truly look forward to returning to Haw River State Park for other workshops and maybe just for a visit.   While we live in Atlanta we may find reasons to drive to North Carolina.   \r\n\r\nSincerely,   Sam Landes\r\n','','','','','complete','','','file_upload/2011_07/RE_A_successful_weekend_at_Haw_River_State_Park.txt','','2011-07-06 15:46:00','Williams5894'),(2191,'Operations','2011-07-06','','CHOP','Kelly Thompson','HARI','HARI Compliment from Jody Usher','Hi Kelley,\r\n \r\nWhat a great weekend (plus Monday) our Re-Evaluation Counseling group had at Haw River State Park over the Memorial Day holiday!  As the on-site organizer, I had the honor of working directly with you and the reception desk staff (Rhonda and Jeannette) on concerns that arose from our group of 60 or so.  From getting an extra blanket for a cabin dweller to coordinating bathroom breaks before they were locked in the evening to making food and sleeping accommodations, all of you went the extra mile.  The delay in construction around us may have created challenges for you.  I know the power was unexpectedly out in one room and water was not available in two sinks.  Yet you and the courteous staff members made our time together seamlessly comfortable.\r\n \r\nWe were together as a group to imagine a war-free world by healing our own distresses from US Wars.  The kitchen staff provided nourishing food that met LOTS of special needs and served us with smiles and warmth.  The cabins and cottages gave us comfortable sleeping quarters for the few hours we slept (!) and the meeting spaces opening to the woods and gardens reminded us of \"benign reality\" all around.  You even supported our desire to \"surprise\" two who were celebrating birthdays by baking THREE cakes so vegan, gluten-free AND other eaters could partake!!\r\n \r\nA special thanks to YOU, Kelley, for instructing us so professionally about timeframes and use of spaces as we got started.  Your sense of humor, appreciation of human frailties, and willingness to think creatively while completing your duties provided a soft cushion throughout the four days we were there.  Your being \"in charge\" left plenty of room for others to take leadership as well.  A woman at the helm doesn\'t always get treated well.  It was a treat for me to work shoulder-to-shoulder with you and notice the respect your colleagues show you.\r\n \r\nWhether our paths cross again or not, you left an indelible mark in my life.\r\n \r\nAll the best,\r\n \r\nJody\r\n \r\nJody Usher\r\nAnderson, SC\r\n','Kelly,\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you and your staff went above and beyond to meet the group?s needs.

The e-mail policy and procedure documents memorialize some existing standards such as archiving and availability of e-mail as a public record. The e-mail policy and procedure documents also add new standards such as prohibiting e-mail backgrounds and personal images, statements or \"tag lines\" at the end of e-mails.  The managed print policy and procedure documents begin the process of centralizing printers at ratios between 8:1 and 15:1 depending on the distance from the printer.\r\n\r\nYou may review each policy and procedure at the following link:  http://portal.ncdenr.org/group/tmc/policies \r\n\r\nThank you to the Technology Management and Sustainability committees for taking the time and effort to collect input and make recommendations for these policies.

The group was portraying their regiment history during the year 1861.  There were no union forces on the island at that time.  I have looked on their website and the 26th re-enactment group does portray Union forces (24th Regiment Michigan Infantry) at the proper re-enactment sites.  Since they were portraying garrison life at the Fort Macon in 1861 then having just Confederate Uniforms would be historic correct.    When it comes to a volunteer group racial makeup, it would be against the law for the park to tell  a volunteer group what racial makeup they must have.  The program did not go into the politics of the  Confederacy or Union.  Most of the 26th were speaking in first person character of 1861.  In the past the Divisionâ€™s legal advisors have told the park that we could not dictate that a group speaks about both Confederate and Union, because it violated the groups freedom of speech.  If the Division is having a presentation on the Civil War in general then both Union and Confederate  interpretation should be presented.  This particular program was on garrison life for the  26th NC Regiment while station in this area in 1861 and not politics of the Confederacy . .  I feel the 26th would have spoken about both Union and Confederate politics if we had asked them to get in to politics of the war.  If any re-enactment group wanting to volunteer and portray  Union forces, then the park  would treated them the same.  \r\nRandy\r\n','From: Lambert, Mike \r\nSent: Monday, November 28, 2011 11:27 AM\r\nTo: Newman, Randy\r\nCc: Oneal, Adrian; Williams, Denise\r\nSubject: FW: Ft.

This Tool called the Budget History Matrix  allows your District Office to literally create an unlimited number of reports to pull numbers together. It has also been designed to run as fast as possible. \r\n \r\nFirst, I\'ll walk thru the \"matrix\" as it first shows up when you enter it. \r\n \r\n1) Under CID Main Menu, select:  Budget History Matrix \r\n \r\n2) You have now entered the \"Matrix\"  with a number of items \"highlighted in yellow\". The items highlighted give you a description of the financial numbers showing up in the Report. They can be changed, but before changing them let\'s walk thru the items that are highlighted when you first enter the \"matrix\". Beginning from Top to Bottom you should see the following items highlighted:\r\n \r\na) Reports is highlighted (This should always be \"highlighted\" when looking at Financial Reports)\r\nb) Center (There are 2 types of Financial Reports: Center & Budget Group)\r\nc) 2011-11-16 should be \"highlighted\". This means that financial information is updated thru November 16, 2011. \r\n    Transactions POSTED in NCAS (North Carolina Accounting System) thru November 16,2011 are reflected in all \r\n     Reports available thru the \"Matrix\". This date changes each time I download data from NCAS (usually weekly).\r\n    \r\n    NOTE:  fiscal year & calendar year financial reports are available for the last 10 years.  Reports created using a \r\n               Range of Dates (ie. January 1, 2011 thru June 30, 2011) go back to January 1, 2009. \r\n \r\nd)Section column should show ALL highlighted (means that Report information provides totals for ALL Sections in \r\n   NC State Parks. ALL means ALL Centers/RCC\'s for NC State Parks. )\r\n \r\ne)Accounts column should show ALL highlighted (means that Report information provides totals for ALL NCAS   \r\n   Accounts (remember financial transactions at your Park/District either get booked to \"Receipt\" Accounts or \r\n   \"Disbursement/Expenditure\" Accounts.  You\'re either bring money in or spending money.  All simply means ALL \r\n    financial information (both Receipts & Disbursements/Expenditures) is reflected in Report.\r\n \r\nf)History column should show 10yr highlighted. This means that Report is showing 10 years worth of financial information in Report. You\'ll notice on your screen that financial information on your screen begins with column named 1112 (this column is financial information for Fiscal year 1112). In addition to Fiscal Year 1112, you have 10 years of history (fiscal years 1011 back to fiscal year 0102)\r\n \r\ng)Period column should show fyear highlighted. This means the Reports are based on the Fiscal Year \"period of time\" as opposed to cyear(calendar year)  or range (range of dates).\r\n \r\nNow let\'s walk thru a specific example courtesy of Christina at North District Office. This example will allow your District Office to see Temporary Payroll Expenditure totals for your District POSTED to NCAS from January 1, 2011 thru June 30,2011. Follow these Steps:\r\n \r\n1) After entering the Matrix you\'ll need to change the \"highlights\" as follows:\r\n \r\n2) Next to Financial Reports, Click on: Budget Group . This will change Budget Group to yellow\r\n \r\n3) In Section Column, Click on: Operations.  You will now notice that Operations is Highlighed & next to Districts, \r\n   you\'ll notice that ALL is highlighted. Click on your District (East,North,South,or West) to see your District. Once \r\n   select your District, it should be highlighted.\r\n \r\n4) In Accounts Column, Click on: Disburse. You will notice that Disburse is highlighted. This means that your are looking at fincancial information for Disbursements/Expenditures. Remember: Temporary Payroll is a Disbursement of Funds. \r\n \r\n5)Ignore the History column.\r\n \r\n6)In Period column, Click on: Range.  You will notice that Range is Highlighted meaning that you are creating a Report using a Range of Dates. You\'ll also notice 2 new Rows named Start & End showed up.

The following web link is the full report from the PED that was shared with members of the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee this morning:  http://www.ncleg.net/PED/Reports/RecentReports.html  There are of course some items of concern; however, the report also verifies important work that is being done.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted the report and referred it to a subcommittee for further review. Members of the subcommittee are Sen. Ralph E. Hise Jr. - Avery, Haywood, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Yancey; Sen. Richard Gunn Jr. - Alamance, Caswell; Rep. Edgar V. Starnes - Caldwell, and Rep. David R. Lewis - Harnett. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that any recommendations proposed in this report will require actions from the General Assembly in the coming session if they are to be implemented.  We will be providing further updates and of course welcome your comments in the coming days as the findings and recommendations of this attractions study are given further consideration.\r\n\r\nThe state park system in North Carolina is providing quality outdoor recreation to a record number of visitors, conserving the natural heritage of North Carolina, and enjoys more advocates and public support than at anytime in its 96-year history.

I have noticed when you go to BEACON there will be a message scrolling across the screen telling you that your NCID password will expire in so many days.  Please make a note and change it before it expires.  This will save you the headaches of trying to get it reset after it expires.\r\n\r\nTo change it:  Go to NCID.NC.GOV and sign into NCID.  Then make the password changeâ€”Be sure to wait for the sync and log back into NCID using the new password to ensure that it is working correctly.\r\n\r\nPasswords must be at least eight characters with one being a number and one being a special character.  You canâ€™t have three consecutive letters or number such as 111 or aaa.  \r\n\r\nWrite it down so you donâ€™t forget it.\r\n\r\nAnother word of advice is that if it does expire you can go to another computer and go to NCID.NC.Gov and log in there.  If you do not remember your password, you can use your challenge questions.   You can have someone else put a DOTS ticket in for you or call 919-707-8900 the operations help desk. \r\n\r\nIf you do not remember your challenge questions, when you get your password finally reset, I would suggest you go to NCID and redo the challenge questions to something you will remember.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you lock yourself out on the weekends you can wait 2 hours and it will automatically unlock.  This feature works 24 hours a day.\r\n\r\nRemember to put in a DOTS ticket when you can.  Your issues will be expedited to the proper person to handle your problems.  This method of reporting issues is protocol and your issues will be resolved faster this way.\r\n\r\nFYI - In addition to calling or having someone else enter a DOTS ticket for you, you can text or email to denr.support@ncdenr.gov, which also creates a DOTS ticket\r\n\r\nAll these tips will save you considerable time in the future.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.\r\n\r\nDENR ITS  Operations Help Desk\r\nHave a great Week!\r\n','added to the FIND database 3/19/2012.dw','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_03/NCID_Password_Tips_-UPDATED_3-19-2012_DENR.docx','','2012-06-18 19:37:14','Quinn0398'),(2432,'APC','2012-03-19','','DISU,PASU,OA\'s OPS','Christina','APC','2012 Administrative Training E-Memo to DISU\'s, PASU\'s, & OA\'s','E-MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nTO:		District Superintendents, District OAs, Park Superintendents, Park OAs\r\n\r\nThrough:	Denise Williams, Administrative Assistant, Operations \r\n\r\nFROM:		Christina Cucurullo, Administrative Council Chair \r\n		\r\nSUBJECT:	2012 Administrative Professional Training\r\n\r\nThe 2012 Administrative Professional Training will take place from May 7 â€“ 10 (NODI/WEDI) and May 14 â€“ 17 (EADI/SODI) at HARI. The introduction to several new databases this year has made it imperative for all Division Office Assistants to attend this yearâ€™s Administrative Professional Training. Some of these databases are currently in use, and more will be in place by the time of this yearâ€™s training. Each new database helps us become more efficient, paperless, and transparent. It is important that all Office Assistants have a thorough understanding of these tools and how to use them at the park level. \r\n\r\nAside from focusing on database functionality, other major sections will include:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Budget (accounting procedures, purchasing, approval workflows, FAS, inventories, database tracking, Budget Matrix)\r\nâ€¢	Database Management (resources, interactive training, archives, website, data processing skills)\r\nâ€¢	HR (BEACON workflows, permanent and seasonal HR databases, workmanâ€™s comp, secondary employment database)\r\nâ€¢	Communication/Customer Service (conflict resolution, serving difficult customers, workplace communication skills, ethics)\r\nâ€¢	Word/Excel/Outlook skills instruction\r\nâ€¢	Electronic file management\r\n\r\n\r\nThis training will be mandatory for all Office Assistants and available to Superintendents experiencing staff shortages. Training will be particularly beneficial to those with office assistant positions that are vacant and could potentially remain that way for an extended period. Both weeks of training are listed on the Division Training Calendar, and all Office Assistants and other attending staff will need to sign up through the database. All attendees are required to bring their park laptop for training purposes, as well as to allow IT to perform updates.  Following the training, all materials will be made available to superintendents and will be placed on FIND for future reference.  The agenda will include instruction from a number of division staff, with assistance and support provided by the Administrative Professional Council. \r\n\r\nSchedule: May 7 â€“ 10, 2012 (NODI/WEDI), May 14- 17, 2012 (EADI/SODI). If you have a schedule conflict with the week assigned to your district, please contact me by email for instructions on how to sign up for the other week of training. Thank you for your support.\r\n','Good Morning,\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached memo in regards to the 2012 Administrative Professional Training. Attendance is mandatory for all OAs and will take place at HARI from May 7 â€“ 10 (NODI/WEDI) and May 14 â€“ 17 (EADI/SODI).

I am a member of Triad Bloodhounds, and we recently held a training at Mayo River State Park in Mayodan, NC.\r\n \r\nAs I understand the regulations about \"pets\", service animals and search and rescue dogs are considered \"exempt\" from the standard \"pet\" regulations in State parks. \r\n \r\nMost of our dogs are bloodhounds that work to find their person on a leash much LONGER than 6 foot long, but SOME of our dogs are SPECIFICALLY TRAINED to work OFF-LEASH but areunder the handler\'s vocal control at all times.  At our recent training session, the park personel objected to us using \"longer than regulated\" leashes and also objected to us training with dogs that worked off-leash.  These dogs are intensively trained, are considered \"police dogs\" (although NONE of them are aggressive -- they think it\'s a game of \"hide-and-seek\" and are HAPPY to find their target!) and we are ONLY called out for use by law enforcement or emergency management.  All of our dog teams (1 dog with 1 handler) are certified through Eastern States Working Dog Association yearly, and we have a SOLID history of being professional and having control of our dogs.  Triad Bloodhounds run under the jurisdiction of the Rockingham Sheriff\'s Department, so we\'re not some fly-by-night agency.\r\n \r\nAre there NO exceptions/exemptions to this rule??  If we were ever called to find a lost/missing person in a State park, would the same rules -- 6 foot leash, no dog off-leash -- still apply??  We aren\'t trying to \"buck the system\" but we need to train our dogs like we WORK our dogs, and if we can\'t use North Carolina State Parks to train, how can we be expected to FIND missing people in NC State Parks??\r\n \r\nI understand that the rules are in place for EVERYONE\'S benefit, but the day we were training at Mayo River State Park, it was cold and raining, and there were NO other people in the park while we were there.  If there had been other people there (as a PROFESSIONAL AGENCY) we would have either changed our training routines or moved to another place . . .  That\'s NOT what occurred, though.  We work with various law enforcement agencies regularly, and are more than willing to follow rules that make sense, which is ALSO why on that day at Mayo River State Park, we obeyed when the park rangers \"corrected\" us . . .  We DID NOT argue that State regulations claim \"service animals and search and rescue dogs\" are EXEMPT from the standard rules.  \r\n \r\nI am writing to ask for clarification on these rules.  If a child or a person with Alzheimer\'s disease went missing in a State park, my guess is if Triad Bloodhounds were called to assist in finding them, the State park system would allow us to work to find that person, reguardless of whether or not our dogs worked on a \"six-foot leash\" or ran off-leash!!  Please explain WHY we cannot TRAIN in NC State parks under those same conditions?\r\n \r\nThank you for your time and consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nMary Lou Stevens   \r\n','Cc: Nygard, Erik; Martin, Keith\r\nSubject: Search Dogs in State Parks\r\n\r\nMs. Stevens,\r\n\r\nI apologize for the delay in responding to your e-mail.  We are very appreciative of the work you do with the Triad Bloodhounds organization and we strive to have a positive working relationship with all of our search and rescue partners.  We have worked extensively with local search and rescue organizations as well as the North Carolina Search and Rescue Dog Association in past years.  \r\n\r\nSearch and Rescue training utilizing search animals can be conducted in our parks through a special activity permit.  Our park rule concerning animals at large doesnâ€™t have an exemption specifically for search animals but we can normally accommodate requests for training through the permit process.  I am copying Mayo River State Park Superintendent Keith Martin on this e-mail, as he will be able to assist you with the process to obtain a permit for training at Mayo River.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me directly at 919-715-7602 if I can be of further assistance.    \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael D.

He reiterated the same concerns that he had discussed with Larry in his original complaint.  He suggested that our category â€œFamily Campingâ€, was discriminatory and cited recent publicity and votes on the marriage amendment (Amendment One).  He suggested that we consider changing the name to a more appropriate title.  I explained the variety of campsites that are available in our loops that include tents, RVâ€™s, and motor homes.  I explained that the title was not meant to be discriminatory and that Family Camping was a traditional name used by our state park system and the National Park Service.  His suggestion was â€œSmall Groupâ€.  \r\n\r\nI explained our policy regarding group camps and our intent to provide a suitable area for large groups to assemble for meals and educational opportunities.  I also explained that we are limited based on the size of campsites in the family campground, limiting capacity to 6 people. He understood this policy but argued that based on the size of his Scout Group he could be considered a family with parents being on-site and could stay in two sites in the family campground.\r\n\r\nI understand that you were trying to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the family campground by not recommending the scouts wear their uniforms in the campground as to not encourage other groups to use the family campground instead of the group camp.  We should not discourage scout troops from wearing their uniforms.  I understand your intent but we should not say that to any group.  \r\n\r\nI spoke with Mr. Johnson in detail and offered that he could stay in the family campground or group camp and that his scouts could wear their uniform.  He and his scouts take a great deal of pride in their uniform just as we do.  I also mentioned that we have partnered with scouts on a number of park projects in the past and would be willing to consider working with his group as well.  \r\n\r\nHe has my contact numbers but had not decided whether he would stay at MOMO this weekend or if he would use the family campground or group sites.  He brought up the concern of retaliation because he had complained but I told him that would not be the case and that we appreciated him offering his perspective.\r\n\r\nLarry, he did say that you were very professional in your demeanor and that you handled the situation with tact.  I know it is not a simple task taking on the added responsibility of managing Morrow Mountain but know that we appreciate your assistance immensely.  \r\n\r\nI will let you know if I speak with Mr. Johnson again.     \r\n\r\nMichael D.

I\'ve copied the district superintendent and chief of operations.  They\'ll check on it immediately.  (FYI, our park superintendent at Morrow Mountain recently resigned to accept a position in Raleigh PD.)\r\n\r\nLewis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBegin forwarded message:\r\n\r\nFrom: \"Jones, Lori\" <lori.jones@ncdenr.gov>\r\nSubject: Curt Johnson - 910-818-8987 Parks issue he wishes to discuss\r\nDate: May 30, 2012 5:56:54 PM EDT\r\nTo: \"Ledford, Lewis\" <lewis.ledford@ncdenr.gov>\r\nCc: \"Knight, David\" <david.knight@ncdenr.gov>\r\n\r\nSaid superintendent of Morrow Mountain told him that he and his scouts have no choice but to go the group location if they want to wear their scout uniforms.  They only have 7 boys + 3 adults and would really like to go to the family area because it is cheaper and closer to facilities but wants to wear Boy Scouts uniform.  He is upset that he was told he has no choice -- the group camping area ($48 for group 4- 45 people & not close to facilities) itâ€™s more expensive.  He asks:  who defines â€œfamilyâ€ feels wording should be changed to â€œsmall groupâ€ and â€œlarge groupâ€.  If they go to family, they cannot wear.  He said when you go to register on-line as family, it does not indicate that you cannot wear uniformsâ€”he made the call and was told by superintendent that he cannot wear scout uniforms but said if he registered on line and showed up in uniforms, then what?  If they are in the â€œfamilyâ€ location, would they be able to put on uniforms to go on a hike?  He indicated their group is made up of families.    \r\n \r\nHe is a teacher and cannot be reached during normal working hours and has asked for someone to call him this evening if at all possible.  If not, please share a detailed response with me and I will call him tomorrow evening.   \r\n \r\nThank you.\r\n \r\n \r\nLori Jones                            lori.jones@ncdenr.gov\r\nExecutive Assistant to Secretary Dee Freeman & Chief Deputy Secretary Mary Penny Thompson\r\nNorth Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources\r\nStreet Address:  217 W Jones Street, 5th floor, Room 5314-D, Raleigh, NC  27603-6100\r\nMailing Address: 1601 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC  27699-1601\r\nTelephone:  919-707-8625\r\n \r\nE-mail correspondence to and from this address may be subject to the North Carolina Public Records Law and may be disclosed to third parties.\r\n \r\n\r\n','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_06/FW_Curt_Johnson_-_910-818-8987__Parks_issue_he_wishes_to_discuss_Confidential.htm','','2012-06-01 12:17:14','Williams5894'),(2487,'Operations','2012-06-01','','CHOP','Brush','','Brush, Tick bite complaint','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_06/Brush_orig_complaint_5-9-2012.pdf,file_upload/2012_06/Brush_orig_complaint-response_CHOP_5-21-12.pdf,file_upload/2012_06/Brush__D_complaint_5-21-2012.pdf','','2012-06-01 13:48:42','Williams5894'),(2488,'Operations','2012-06-01','','CHOP','Siobhan Oneal','','Donald Umphlett-draft letter on letterhead','gave to CHOP for revisions','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_06/Umphlett_D_MEMI_Corresp_draft.docx','','2012-06-01 13:52:18','Williams5894'),(2489,'OPAA','2012-06-01','','denise','Tony Bass','','RVP POSITION REQUEST- CALCULATING WORKDAYS FOR THE 6MONTH REQUEST','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_06/Seasonal_position_request_7111-123111.htm','','2017-08-02 16:49:26','Williams5894'),(2490,'Administration','2012-06-04','','DIR','Howerton','','New trail construction approval request for HARO River Bluffs Trail','to Howerton','','6/4/12','','','complete','','','','','2012-06-04 21:14:39','Eikinas5239'),(2491,'Administration','2012-06-04','','DIR','Howerton','','New construction approval request for GOCR relocate group camp site #1','to Howerton','','6/4/12','','','complete','','','','','2012-06-04 21:16:32','Eikinas5239'),(2492,'Administration','2012-06-06','','DIR','McNair','','Request to release vacant positions:\r\nWIUM MMI 60033240\r\nMOJE OAIII 60032993\r\nGORG OAIV 65016273\r\nEnvir Spec 60032832\r\nGRMO MMIII 65016271','to McNair','','6/6/12','','','complete','','','','','2012-06-06 16:42:37','Eikinas5239'),(2493,'Operations','2012-06-07','','CHOP','Tom Jackson','LANO','LANO \"Swimmers Itch\" complaint and response from PASU','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_06/LANO_Complaint-Swimmers_Itch_PASU_response-FW_Recent_Visit_to_the_Swimming_Area.htm','','2012-06-18 14:54:10','Williams5894'),(2495,'Operations','2012-06-18','','CHOP','CHOP','','Director Courtesy Copies CDL/Concealed Carry Signage RECORDS CHECK MEMORANDUM 6/14/12 & CONCEALED CARY SIGNS 6/11/12','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2012_06/Concealed_Carry_Signs_6-11-12.pdf,file_upload/2012_06/Records_Check_Memorandum_6-14-12.pdf','','2012-06-18 14:54:05','Williams5894'),(2496,'APC','2012-06-18','','APC Council','Karen Wilson','','Thanks','\"To all of you on the APC, a great big THANKS for the Administrative Professional Training.

This back ground information may be beneficial to the director in his upcoming meeting concerning the issues identified below.\r\n\r\nTom \r\n\r\nFrom: Mcelhone, Sean \r\nSent: Sunday, August 19, 2012 7:53 PM\r\nTo: Jackson, Tom\r\nSubject: LAJA Senator Warren Daniel & Mr. Wayne Poe 2012.08.19\r\n\r\nTom,\r\n\r\nBelow is a general timeline of my discussions with Mr. Wayne Poe.  Mr. Poe is a Burke County resident, who is concerned with the lack of camping in the Paddyâ€™s Creek Area of LAJA.\r\n\r\n04/17/2012: Mr. Poe first contacted me at the park office.  During this conversation Mr. Poe stated that he was concerned with the lack of camping opportunities in the Paddyâ€™s Creek Area (PCA).  I advised him of the history of the park expansion, Master Plan and development.  Mr. Poe was not interested in the Master Plan.  He was adamant that camping should be allowed now, even though there were no amenities or facilities to support this type of use.  Mr. Poe was specifically interested in seeing camping opportunities for those campers with pop-ups and RVâ€™s.  Mr. Poe stated that the park had taken away all of the camping opportunities.  I stated that before the park obtained this property it was leased to a hunting club and that there was not access to it for camping by the general public; other than boat camping.\r\n\r\nMr. Poe stated that he thought the park should simply open the gates to the old logging roads and allow people to camp in a primitive nature.  I explained to him the history of misuse by campers, particularly along the lakeâ€™s shoreline.  This misuse resulted in vegetation being removed, large amounts of trash being left behind as well as temporary toilet facilities being constructed by campers, that were simply moved or abandoned when full.  I also stressed that the Division was interested in seeing the PCA developed consistently with the Master Plan and to construct facilities that would offer sustainable services to visitors.  Mr. Poe did not seem willing to accept this as a valid reason to not allow people to camp simply as they saw fit, where ever they wanted.  After our telephone conversation, Mr. Poe requested an in person meeting.  I met with Mr. Poe the following Monday.  \r\n\r\n04/23/2012: On Monday Mr. Poe showed up at the park with Matt Gupton, the Burke County Environmental Health Specialist.  I reviewed the Master Plan with both gentlemen.  Mr. Gupton was very familiar with the Master Plan and the existing facilities at the PCA.  Mr. Poe was again very adamant that there is no reason that the park shouldnâ€™t simply allow camping.  Mr. Gupton was very supportive of the park and stated that he thought the park should be developed accordingly and that following the parkâ€™s Master Plan would result in better facilities.\r\n\r\nDuring this meeting Mr. Poe was very focused on his impression that camping could be allowed without providing any sort of septic system or waste collection.  Mr. Gupton, in fact stated that there would have to be some sort of septic system installed unless the sites were within a reasonable distance of existing facilities.  A reasonable distance would be a few hundred yards of the only existing facility, which is the PCA bathhouse.\r\n\r\n05/03/2012:  Mr. Poe called the park office to inform me that he had spoken to Senator Warren Daniel regarding the issue of camping at LAJA.  He then stated that Sen. Daniel was going to contact me at the park to inquire about the issue.  Mr. Poe also asked for my supervisorâ€™s name and contact information.\r\n\r\n05/09/2012:  I spoke to Sen. Daniel on the phone regarding Mr. Poe and his complaints about the lack of camping at LAJA.  I informed Sen. Daniel of the parkâ€™s Master Plan, what had already been developed with the PCA and what was planned to occur next. I explained that there was more to offering camping within a state park than simply opening up old logging roads and allowing camping anywhere.  This included road improvements, restroom facilities, patrolling/enforcing rules, collecting fees, etc.\r\n\r\nI  also explained to Sen. Daniel the restrictions that the Dedicated Nature Preserve and Clean Water Management Trust Fund funding would place on any new development.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of 05/09 I went to Sen. Danielâ€™s office in Morganton and gave him two copies of the parkâ€™s Master Plan.  We spoke very briefly about the Master Plan.\r\n\r\n08/01/2012:  Mr. Poe called the park office to inquire if any funding had been designated for camping development, since the state budget had been passed.  I informed him that the funding coming from PARTF doesnâ€™t follow the state budget year, and that it would most likely be the end of October, before funding decisions would be made for capital improvement projects.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Mr. Poe stated that he thought it was a shame that the park land is laying there just going to waste, that he didnâ€™t think there was any money for construction projects and that he thought the park should simply let people camp wherever they wanted.\r\n\r\n08/01 was the last conversation I had with Mr. Poe.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can provide any more information.\r\n\r\nSean\r\n\r\n\r\nSean R.

I am writing you today to request that the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, offer a \"Lifetime Park Pass\" at a discounted rate for the Disabled Veterans Residents of North Carolina.

We realize this long standing policy can be an inconvenience for some of our overnight visitors.  However, many of our overnight visitors have expressed appreciation for the added security and peace and quiet afforded by our gates and the fact they are not disturbed by late arrivals or campers returning to the park during later hours. Gates are installed to provide a safe environment for our visitors, protect park facilities and resources and to limit access to hazards associated with the outdoor environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, our policy of locking park gates at night and our efforts to ensure access for our overnight visitors is a priority that receives continuous review.  I recently led a small team of division employees in the completion of a study to look at the divisionâ€™s operational hours and gate procedures.  The focus of this project was to evaluate our abilities to provide ingress and egress for registered overnight guests to North Carolina State Parks. During the project, the team gathered information from several sources to develop a comprehensive gate policy.  Information collection methods included conducting surveys of our park visitors, state and national park systems and our park staff.  We are considering a number of options for the gate policy, and your thoughts and suggestions are valid and timely.  \r\n\r\nThe manner in which our staff interacted with you at Stone Mountain is of great concern to me.  Our Park Rangers are routinely on stand-by and available for call-out at any given time. I assure you that this particular incident will be discussed with the current park superintendent.   \r\n\r\nAgain, I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns with me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D.

This weekend my husband and I are trying Lake Norman State Park for the first time and so far we are enjoying it.\r\n\r\nThe reason for my email today is regarding your gate system.  Before moving to North Carolina, we have camped in Wisconsin, Alaska, Montana, Idaho, South Carolina, and Kentucky.  Some of these states have gates on the campgrounds, but they still allow the campers to come and go with codes.  This allowed us to enjoy the areas and events around the campgrounds.  Once we moved to North Carolina, we had the shock of not being able to have as much freedom.  What is the reason for locking the gate for a 12 hour period?\r\n\r\nAs an example we love to camp at Jordan Lake and we work near the park.  Unfortunately, we are not able stay the entire week or partial week, which would allow us to enjoy the park and lake while still working.  We cannot wait until 8:00 AM to leave the park and we are not allowed to park outside the gate.  \r\n\r\nA few years ago we were camping at Stone Mountain and we experienced the worst scenario possible.  A kid fell off his bike and cracked his head open.  My friend and I went to the pay phone and called 911.  After dialing 911 we found a Ranger who explained he was off duty and had to find the on-duty Ranger or the camp host to open the gate for the ambulance.  Needless to say the boy had to be lifted over the gate so that he could be placed in the ambulance.  If one of us would have had a code this could have been prevented.\r\n\r\nI have plenty of more examples of why the system should be different, but that probably does not matter.  I appreciate your time reading this email and I look forward to hearing the theory to locking the gates.\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nDanielle\r\n','','','','','complete','','','','','2013-01-24 14:34:11','Williams5894'),(2593,'Administration','2012-10-25','','DIR','Howerton','','Demolition approval request for CLNE (concession room at picnic shelter)','to Howerton','','10/26/12','','','complete','','','','','2012-10-26 19:34:21','Eikinas5239'),(2594,'Administration','2012-10-25','','DIR','Howerton','','Request for approval for installation of new park entrance sign','to Howerton','','10/26/12','','','complete','','','','','2012-10-26 19:37:31','Eikinas5239'),(2595,'Administration','2012-11-07','','DIR','PACR','','Retirement request for service weapon for ranger Grant Gibson','to PACR','','11/15/12','','','complete','','','','','2012-11-15 21:12:45','Eikinas5239'),(2596,'Administration','2012-11-14','','DIR','Regier','','CRMO RFA - Pinnacle Resources Tract (172 ac.)','to SPO, cc\'s','','11/15/12','electronic','','complete','','','','','2012-11-15 20:50:11','Eikinas5239'),(2597,'Administration','2012-11-14','','DIR','Regier','','PETT PO1 Johnson tract (54 ac.)','to Bryant, SPO, cc\'s','','11/15/12','electronic','','complete','','','','','2012-11-15 21:11:22','Eikinas5239'),(2598,'Administration','2012-11-14','','DIR','Strong','','Forwarding documents for dedicated Nature Preserves to Linda Pearsall (SOMO, MOMI)','to Linda Pearsall - Linda, I would encourage getting this on the January schedule if possible.

Please see the below email and the attachments.  The Friends of CRMO have initiated efforts to have the Gaston County Commissioners pass a resolution to encourage the State to purchase several in holdings at CRMO.  This resolution has been passed each year by Gaston County since 2008. \r\n\r\nThe State Property Office has contacted the owners to initiate discussions on purchasing the property and has actually appraised the property.  However, it appears that the owner is not a willing seller.  The total acreage of these in holdings is approximately 43 acres.\r\n\r\nI briefly discussed this with Sue Regier today.  The main purposes for acquiring the property would be to eliminate in holdings, as a buffer against development, to preserve the view shed of the park and protection of significantly rare plant species.  While the park is interested in acquiring these parcels, since the landowner is unwilling to sell, we may not have many options at the moment.\r\n\r\nSean\r\n\r\nSean R.

This is the kudzu eradication plan using goats at LAJA.  The proposal includes a guard dog (Great Pyrenees) in a fenced-in pen with the goats.  The animals would be behind an electric fence.  This is a standard practice at all the sites for which Wells Farms has provided goats for kudzu eradication.  Park staff have agreed to check on the animals daily.  \r\n\r\nI think this is a good idea and that the site at LAJA will provide a good test for other applications throughout the Division.  The site is not near any visitor use areas and is isolated from any park neighbors or other development.  The cost of chemical and the staff commitment to treat this tract with a herbicide would both be immense.\r\n\r\nPark staff are requesting major maintenance funding, but LAJA PASU Nora Coffey has also agreed to assist from the park\'s operating expenses budget where appropriate.  The Resource Management section has endorsed this plan and Mountain Region Biologist worked closely with park staff in developing this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to start this May.  \r\n\r\nHere is the website for Mr. Searcy\'s goats:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wellsfarmgoats.com/home\r\n\r\nWe realize this will be a new approach for invasive species eradication, but the park staff have given this its considerable thought and I support their efforts.

The purpose of the research is to update the 2005-2006 Economic Contribution Study and reexamine the economic impact of visitors to our parks and nearby communities.  The survey protocol and schedule is still being finalized but data will be collected by teams of two research assistants visiting each park four times throughout the year.  Each visit will consist of two days, totaling eight days throughout the year.  At the same time, the researchers will be validating the number of people per vehicle and multiplier used for our daily attendance.  \r\n\r\nPlease make every effort to accommodate the researchers with their needs including overnight lodging in campgrounds, barracks or cabins if they are available. Researchers will be positioned in areas of the park that provide the best opportunity to survey park visitors.  Direct them to known areas in the park where they can survey the greatest number of visitors with their limited time.  I would also suggest highlighting any special events or programs that are taking place in your park that may be of interest to them.  I am attaching background information for the study along with contact information for all of you to aid Candace Vick and Roger Moore who are heading up the project.  Additional information will be provided when schedules are finalized.    \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your assistance with this important survey. \r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D.

Attached are several articles from the US Department of Labor and private business sources.  As usual, nothing is cut and dry.  Most direction is from case law, rather than legislation or rule making.  On one hand our personnel are required to stay on premise.  That alone would substantiate the need for compensation.  However, on premise is also their home so restriction on their personal life is only partial.  Location and personal affairs restrictions are key components in on-call compensation requirements.  Another key component is the frequency of call outs which in our staff perspective can be high but if you follow the provided examples in these articles might be considered low.  A key point made in some of my reading did state that it is not always a legal concern, but rather a concern for recruiting and retaining employees.\r\n\r\nFrom a personal perspective; my wife Sheila receives on-call pay.  Based on these articles she was eligible in Stokes County because of the volume of call outs.  However, here in Durham/Orange/Granville counties the volume of call outs is much lower, she is not tied to a location, and is largely unrestricted in her personal activities and from a legal stand point her agency probably is not required to pay on-call.  However, if they did not, they would not be able to hire nurses.  Sheila receives $1.25 an hour to be on call here and received $2.50/hour in Stokes County.  In both cases she was on the clock at full compensation when responding to a call.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful.\r\n','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2013_03/Federal_On-Call.docx','','2013-09-11 11:58:44','Williams5894'),(2708,'Operations','2013-03-07','','CHOP','JERRY HOWERTON','','MAJOR MAINTENANCE REQUEST FOR 2013','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2013_03/DPR_Major_Maintenance_Request_for_2013final.xlsx,file_upload/2013_03/DPR_MAJOR_MAINTENANCE_REQUEST_FO_R2013_spreadsheet.htm','','2013-09-11 11:58:33','Williams5894'),(2709,'Administration','2013-03-14','','DIR','Howerton','','Renovation approval request for PIMO storage building','to Howerton','','3/14/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-03-14 17:51:22','Eikinas5239'),(2710,'Operations','2013-03-26','','CHOP','Val & Angelia','SODI','VEHICLE TRUCK ORDER FOR DIVISION E-PROCUREMENT 12/2012 FINAL LIST FOR CHOP REVIEW','','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2013_03/FINAL_2013_DPR_Vehicle_Request_list.xlsx,file_upload/2013_04/FINAL_2013_DPR_Vehicle_Request_list-1_4-16-13dw.xlsx,file_upload/2013_04/FINAL_2013_DPR_Vehicle_Request_list4-16-13.xlsx,file_upload/2013_04/FINAL_2013_DPR_Vehicle_Request_list-1_4-16-13dw.xlsx,file_upload/2013_04/2013_DPR_Vehicle_Request_list-4-16-13.xlsx,file_upload/2013_04/purchase_order_vehicle_amounts-per_ML.pdf','','2013-09-11 11:58:22','Williams5894'),(2711,'Administration','2013-03-26','','DIR','Howerton','','New construction approval request for CACR picnic tables, gravel pads','to Howerton','','3/26/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-03-26 16:59:32','Eikinas5239'),(2712,'Administration','2013-03-26','','DIR','Howerton','','New construction approval request for GRMO entrance gates installation','to Howerton','','3/26/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-03-26 16:59:06','Eikinas5239'),(2713,'Administration','2013-03-18','','DIR','McBane','','Town of Clayton trail MST dedication approval','to Skvarla\r\nin from Skvarla','','3/26/13','electronic','','complete','','','','','2013-03-26 15:35:18','Eikinas5239'),(2714,'Administration','2013-03-28','','DIR','McNair','','Recommendation for HR action STMO MMIV (32834)','to McNair','','4/1/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-04-01 15:07:28','Eikinas5239'),(2715,'Administration','2013-03-28','','DIR','McNair','','Recommendation for HR action Budget Office ACV (32794)','to McNair','','4/1/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-04-01 15:09:56','Eikinas5239'),(2716,'Administration','2013-04-01','','DIR','Howerton','','New construction approval request LANO Dragonfly Trail ','to Howerton - Why is this not handled though CI?','','','','','complete','','','','','2013-06-11 14:09:59','Eikinas5239'),(2717,'Administration','2013-04-01','','DIR','Howerton','','Renovation approval request SOMO footbridge/boardwalk section on High Shoals Falls Loop.','to Howerton','','4/2/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-04-02 14:24:42','Eikinas5239'),(2718,'Administration','2013-04-01','','DIR','Howerton','','Renovation approval request for GOCR -relocate kiosk to campground for firewood','to Howerton','','4/2/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-04-02 15:00:29','Eikinas5239'),(2719,'Administration','2013-04-01','','DIR','Howerton','','Demolition approval request for SOMO abandoned house (Barron prop)','to Howerton - Are we sure about asbestos.

Iâ€™ve called him each day since we spoke at WEWO leaving messages each time.  He indicates that the â€œnighttime fishing has gotten worse this year and that he cussed some people out a few nights ago that were shining lights on his house at midnightâ€.  I explained the state lake rules but he said that â€œnobody ever does anything about the problemâ€.  He advised that people are accessing the lake via the wildlife ramp and congregating at the dam and along Waccamaw Shores Road. He brought up the point that he would be less likely to support funding for Hydrilla eradication given the recent problems.  He also stated that he could petition the residents on Waccamaw Shores Road because they are having the same issue with fisherman.  He doesnâ€™t mind the fishing during reasonable hours but thinks the late night fishing is unreasonable.  He did not have boat numbers or other information on the fisherman.  What are your thoughts about installing signage at the ramps to remind fisherman of the residences near the lakeshore.  I mentioned that we could coordinate an effort with Wildlife and make them aware of the problem.  Let me know if you have other suggestions.

All of you have been coordinating with your District Superintendents to work through the operational details to implement this change at your park. I appreciate your efforts and willingness to work through these important details given all of the other responsibilities that you have.  Operations Staff had a goal to pilot the change this summer, anticipating an implementation in early June.  However, given the current permanent staffing levels and hiring freeze that is impacting our division we have decided to postpone the pilot project until later this year. Our hope is that the hiring freeze will be lifted and that we will be in a better position to expand operational hours for the public. At this point, our goal is to implement the pilot project beginning August 1, 2013 and continue monitoring the project through the end of December 2013.  This should give adequate time to gather additional data and feedback from visitors and park staff during the pilot phase of the project. \r\n \r\nDuring presentations at ALERT and discussions with my staff, I have been made aware of the continued interest in implementing an on-call policy.  The team of division employees that gathered information and developed the gate policy also recognized the importance of having a policy to ensure a timely response to members of the public requiring assistance while staying overnight in a park.  Between now and August 1, we plan to re-submit the draft on-call policy to the new administration in an attempt to gain resolution and to better define on-call and emergency callback in keeping with Departmental and Office of State Personnel policy. \r\n   \r\nAdditional Information will be provided prior to implementing the gate policy and expanded operational hours later this year.  In the meantime, continue to coordinate through your District Superintendent and operate your facilities as you have in previous years with visitor and staff safety being paramount in all decisions. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D.

Last year, I led a team of State Park employees from across the state with the task of reviewing the divisionâ€™s operational hours and gate policies.  Our focus was how North Carolina State Parks could improve ingress and egress for registered overnight guests at campgrounds, cabins and lodges.  There was emphasis on accommodating all of our park users including the large segment that appreciate the extra security and quiet time that the current gate hours provide. \r\n\r\nAs part of the review, the team collected information from several sources and three different surveys to develop a pilot program. This information included surveying park visitors to obtain their feedback about the current operational policies.  We also surveyed other southeastern state, national and municipal park systems as well as our park superintendents.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing survey results and information sources, the team developed a pilot policy to address extending operational hours at all state parks and recreation areas with overnight facilities.  The policy also includes providing a minimum of one facility at each state recreation area that would provide access without locked gates. Our plans are to introduce the change later this year.

It has been several weeks since I have gotten your reply and have been meaning to respond and have just now made time.  I appreciate your information and will look forward to seeing how this change works.\r\n \r\nI\'m a little concerned about totally opening the gates at all times and how that will affect security and quiet hours.  I realize that it is trully an impossible job to please everyone with so many different ideas of what is reasonable gate hours and egress and ingress of the parks.  I am open to change and am willing to wait and see how it works before I make my mind up.  I too have been at a number of different campgrounds and have observed several different methods and hours.  Most of the campgrounds that I have been to that didn\'t have a check in station manned 24/7 had some type of electronic gate with a numeric code for access to those campers that had already checked in.  One National park in western NC (Davidson River) has a man at the gate 24/7 but only allows egress after certain hours.  I\'m sure you have seen many others and considered them in your study.  I also realize that with our NC budget that most of our state agencies are operating on very limited resources and that may limit what you are able to offer.\r\n \r\nI will look forward to seeing how your new system works.  I will be camping in the Jordan Lake campgrounds over the next few months and will be very interested in how it affects the camping there.\r\n \r\nDavid Marks\r\n \r\n----- Original Message ----- \r\nFrom: Lambert, Mike \r\nTo: davidmarks@firstbaptistpinehurst.com \r\nCc: Mole, Shederick ; Dowdy, Bryan ; Williams, Denise \r\nSent: Wednesday, May 22, 2013 10:32 AM\r\nSubject: gate hours\r\n\r\nMr. Marks,\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in Jordan Lake State Recreation Area.   Last year, I led a team of State Park employees from across the state with the task of reviewing the divisionâ€™s operational hours and gate policies.  Our focus was how North Carolina State Parks could improve ingress and egress for registered overnight guests at campgrounds, cabins and lodges.  There was emphasis on accommodating all of our park users including the large segment that appreciate the extra security and quiet time that the current gate hours provide. \r\n\r\nAs part of the review, the team collected information from several sources and three different surveys to develop a pilot program. This information included surveying park visitors to obtain their feedback about the current operational policies.  We also surveyed other southeastern state, national and municipal park systems as well as our park superintendents.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing survey results and information sources, the team developed a pilot policy to address extending operational hours at all state parks and recreation areas with overnight facilities.  The policy also includes providing a minimum of one facility at each state recreation area that would provide access without locked gates. Our plans are to introduce the change later this year.  We had anticipated piloting the operational changes by June but due to reduced staffing levels and a hiring freeze we have decided to postpone until later this year. \r\n\r\nFeel free to call me directly if you have questions or need additional information.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D.

I have asked Shadrack Mole at Jordan Lake and he has stated that the hours for the gates are not determined at his level but by someone else.  I have camped at Jordan Lake numerous times and have camped in a number of our state parks as well as other state parks.  I feel that the gate hours at Jordan Lake could be much more camper friendly.  If you would open the gates at 6:00 am, then a number of campers could camp for the evening, get up  and go to work and then return after work for the evening.  If the gate hours were to be extended for a little later in the evening, this would allow for some campers to go out to eat in Raleigh and still return before getting locked out of the camp ground.  Since there is  no parking allowed outside of the campground, this puts a fairly restrictive burden on campers trying to enjoy and support your state campgrounds.  I have heard there is some discussion as to changing the hours.  It would seem to me that some type of input from your supporting campers would be of great value in your decision making.  You should have most of the email of your campers since you have to have one to make reservations.  Also, some type of hard copy could be handed out at the check in station and asked to give some feed back about how your campers feel on the service, hours, and facilities.  I would be interested to know who is going to make the decision and how its being researched.\r\n \r\nThank you for your help in this  matter.\r\n \r\nDavid Marks\r\n','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2013_06/RE_gate_hours_Mr.Marks_6-21-13.htm','','2013-09-11 11:56:09','Williams5894'),(2775,'Administration','2013-06-14','','DIR','McNair','','Personnel/position request forms for 10 commissioned LEO\'s','to McNair','','6/21/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-06-21 19:33:07','Eikinas5239'),(2776,'Administration','2013-06-14','','DIR','McNair','','Personnel/position request forms for 3 (separations)','to McNair','','6/21/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-06-21 19:34:27','Eikinas5239'),(2777,'Administration','2013-06-21','','DIR','McNair','','Personnel/position request form 01909930 (LEO) & 01173504 (MMIII)','to McNair','','6/21/13','','','complete','','','','','2013-06-21 19:45:43','Eikinas5239'),(2778,'Operations','2013-06-24','','Ms Dawn Ikis','Mike Lambert','OPAD','Complaint from Dawn Ikis, CABE during the filming of \"Tammy\"','Ms. Ekis;\r\n\r\nFirst let me say that I regret your stay in the campground at Carolina Beach State Park was unpleasant and not the peaceful experience you were seeking.  North Carolina State Parks strives to ensure that all visitors and campers have a rewarding experience during their visits and overnight stays.\r\n\r\nCarolina Beach State Park and the Wilmington area in general have seen a recent increase in movie production companies reserving areas and facilities for filming television shows and films.  While this increase (Carolina Beach State Park has hosted three film productions in the last year) is seen as beneficial to the local economy and provides exposure for the park and the community, it does present management challenges in trying to balance the hectic nature of a movie production and our desire to keep the park open and accessible to the general public.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, your visit to our campground occurred at the same time that the film production for â€œTammyâ€ was underway in the parkâ€™s campground.  Planning and permit acquisition for this particular film began in early spring and included the production company reserving the entire campground loop #2 in order to shoot several film scenes.  It was permitted as a daytime shoot only so that it did not infringe on the campgroundâ€™s quiet hours and the reservation of the entire camping loop was required in hopes of providing a sound buffer that would benefit not only the film production but more importantly, our campers.   Although we feel that we achieved this buffered zone, we also understand that film company vehicle traffic through Loop #1 was fairly continual at some periods and could have been better managed.  Although the company did have a large number of vehicles, equipment trailers and tents associated with the production that may have been annoying or have inconvenienced you and other visitors, we did our best ensure that all of our other parkâ€™s facilities and trails remained open to the general public.\r\n\r\nI am assured that our staff made every effort they could to provide onsite signs, blockade barrels and even campground trail closure notifications during the production so that the public would not inadvertently go into an area that was reserved. An alert notice concerning potential inconveniences from filming was posted on our Divisionâ€™s website, but in the future we will strive to work closer with our centralized reservation system concessionaire to provide better notices and information to the public about potential inconveniences and disruptions in the park and campground proper.\r\n\r\nI can assure you that customer service is an extremely important tenet of our organization and any comment, as flippant as it may have seemed was not intended to belittle your circumstance, concern or complaint.  I have spoken to the Park Superintendent about this concern and the importance of customer service and professionalism by all employees. \r\n\r\nPlease accept my apology for your unpleasant camping experience and I hope that you will continue to visit and enjoy Carolina Beach and other state parks in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael D.

I chose camping because I wanted some peaceful time with nature. \r\nI wish that there had been a way to let me know that the cast of \"Tammy\" was going to invade the campground, before I used my precious vacation days.\r\nTheir using the second loop meant that every time they went out for something to eat, got bored, or had other reasons to leave, they would be circling around past the site that was my \"home\" for the next 3 days. I understand that they were curious as to who was actually camping there, however, in doing so, I lost any sense of privacy I might have otherwise had.\r\n\r\nI imagine the park is a beautiful place as well, but between the semi trucks, and all of the cars, the vans, and the pick up trucks that inundated every part of it, I guess I\'ll never know.\r\n\r\nI did mention my concerns to the office staff and, while I understand that they couldn\'t do anything about the chaos, the remarks that I should \"come back, it\'s only 20 bucks and it\'s normally not so noisy\", and finally: \"I\'ll be sure to tell the Director how you feel\" were unprofessional, and made me feel as if I was the one with the problem.\r\n\r\nNext time, please let (them) take over the whole campground so they can just get it over and done with.

As Adrienne mentioned, I\'m working on a new GeoChallenge feature for the app and would very much like your input. Does NC state parks currently sponsor any geocaches or geochallenges? \r\n \r\nI\'ve come across a number of caches published via geocaching.com. Are these sanctioned or approved by the state or are these submitted by users? If so, are they exclusive or can they be built upon to create challenges? We\'d like to propose a system that would not only catalog these existing caches but enable the public to create geocaches on Division property utilizing the app. By uploading caches through the app, we\'d be able to vet and approve each cache without the need of a paper trail. We\'re also working to brainstorm GeoChallenges that would be implemented throughout the state parks.\r\n\r\nI\'d love the opportunity to speak with you about about this exiting new project that both the state parks and visitors could potentially benefit from greatly.\r\nPlease let me know when would be a good time to discuss. \r\n \r\nThanks!\r\nVirginia\r\n \r\nOn Jan 10, 2012, at 10:46 AM, Eikinas, Adrienne wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Virginia,\r\n \r\nYou can contact Mike Lambert, our Chief of Operations for information on geocaching.\r\n \r\nAlso, in regards to the state naturalist blog, there are two employees who would be great contacts:\r\n \r\nScott Hartley, Superintendent of Weymouth Woods State Nature Preserve scott.hartley@ncdenr.gov\r\n910-692-2167\r\n \r\nRandy Newman, Superintendent of Fort Macon State Park randy.newman@ncdenr.gov\r\n252-726-3775\r\n \r\nThanks, Adrienne\r\n \r\nAdrienne Eikinas\r\nExecutive Assistant to Director Lewis Ledford North Carolina State Parks\r\n919.715.8710\r\nwww.ncparks.gov\r\n \r\n<image001.jpg>\r\n \r\nCorrespondence to and from this address may be subject to the North Carolina Public Records Law and may be disclosed to third parties.\r\n \r\n \r\nrom: Virginia Gil [mailto:virginia@parksbynature.com]\r\nSent: Monday, January 09, 2012 4:25 PM\r\nTo: Eikinas, Adrienne\r\nSubject: Geocache questions\r\n \r\nHi Adrienne,\r\n \r\nHope you had a great new year.

This information will be used to better understand and compare the challenges and opportunities facing recreation service providers and to make better use of shared agency interests. The information we receive will assist the state by capturing providers\' perceptions of recreation supply and demand and will gather opinions about planning and management challenges.\r\n\r\nPlease note that questions 1-4 ask for information about the director of the provider\'s agency. In terms of the way the survey is designed, each superintendent should refer to themselves as the director of their particular park/agency. \r\n\r\nPlease take the time to complete the survey before May 31, 2014.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\nMichael D.

But fishing has turned into a ordeal ,its supost to be a relaxing and peaceful environment along a trout stream ,in nature  ,but you barely get a hook wet and the rangers are checking license and wanting to search you tackle box or any bag even your motorcycle side bags for fish and illegal tackle ,This past Sunday my wife and son and I went to Stone mountain to fish on our last day of Easter vacation ,we had not been there 10 mins when ranger C Starbuck  came bounding out of his truck  ,we my son and me were fly fishing with on luck yet ,when he came up he\'s wanting to search a bag  that was near us with out any propable cause what so ever , he searches it and in the bottom finds a empty power bait bag \"empty\"  we know not to use power bait here and we are not were fly fishing he ask for our license my son shows him his and mine is in my wallet in the car a few feet away ,as I search I find two old license and hand him them as I continue to search he tells me not to bother he can just call it in but I continue searching . they confirm on the radio I have a up to date license  , its about this time that he\'s handing me a warning ticket that he has me sign that said I had power bait and no licenses  , tells me to have a nice day and leaves  two minutes later I find the licenses in my wallet had he waited or no slowed down my search I could have showed him. this disruption of our trip to the park ruined our day and seemed like the final straw as we always seem to checked and re checked I was so upset that I  had chest pains and went for treatment having a EKG and lab work to test for a heart attack , The girl drawing the blood who I had never met  told me that she had tried to trout fish in Stone mountain only to be checked for licence within 5 mins of getting there and being scared by there ranger that she could get a $600 dollar ticket . If this is what the State want there parks to be like then I\'ll keep my money and forget license in NC . even tho the ranger told me I could throw the warning ticket away and had to do nothing else ,it seemed wrong to me ,I was a officer with Surry  and Forsyth county sheriffs deptment over 10\'s ago and I obey the law I have a code of honesty and loyalty that  I taught my son to live by as well as myself . so I hope that you take some action that will restore The great times that people have at Stone Mountain, maybe he believes that this is how he is suppost to do his job , I hope its not ! \r\n\r\n                                                       Sincerely J.W.

HARI has been presenting this Underground Railroad since the parks establishment in 2007 at the request of over 150 overnight groups.  Prior to the acquisition of the Summit the Episcopal Diocese presented the same program.  The program ties to the standard course of study and is commonly requested by overnight school groups. The activities are very controlled and chaperones are involved with every aspect and participate in an orientation which typically lasts 45 minutes.  Kathryn Royall is gathering information for the meeting with the school system and will share when complete.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n  \r\nMichael D.

A few days ago Kelley called to let me know a mother had called to complain after her child returned from their trip and participation in the program.  Her complaint was the program was inappropriate and that her child had been left unsupervised during the program.  The children are not left unsupervised, they are accompanied by their chaperones.  Kelleyâ€™s investigation into the complaint revealed this child was supervised, and if I recall correctly, by the husband of the school principal.  She explained the program and safeguards to the mother who was still not satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe complaining woman has pressed her case further with the school system.  As you will see below, the school system investigated and found the complaint to be unfounded but before reaching that conclusion had already set up a parentsâ€™ meeting and have decided to continue the meeting.  The park staff appears well prepared to handle it and I will follow up with Kelley prior and determine what support she may need.\r\n\r\nKelley tells me she has had only one other complaint in the past regarding the UR and that was from a mother who complained that the program made her child feel guilty.  You may recall we inherited this program from the HARP program and retained it due to its popularity.\r\n\r\nWanted you to be aware should anything arise regarding this complaint.\r\n\r\nDave Cook\r\nNorth District Superintendent\r\n','','','','','complete','','',',file_upload/2014_05/RE__Colfax_complaint_HARI.pdf,file_upload/2014_05/FW__Colfax_complaint_HARI.pdf','','2014-05-12 18:42:09','Williams5894'),(2975,'Operations','2014-05-12','','CHOP','STEVE lIVINGSTON','PHONE-SODI?','COMPLAINT JIM FORD, WILMINGTON NC ','Mike,\r\nJust took (a somewhat difficult) call from Mr. Ford.

It is not in the current plan, but its location to other park properties would seem reasonable.  As for the addition for park housing, that is something that operations will need to decide and justify.  There are other properties with houses in this area that are included in the plan.  But of course we have no idea of availability or cost of these when they may become available.\r\n\r\nPete\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Hyde, Larry \r\nSent: Saturday, March 28, 2015 11:08 AM\r\nTo: McElhone, Sean; Colwell, Pete\r\nSubject: Potential Park Residence or Rental Cabin\r\n\r\nSean and Pete,\r\n\r\nPlease see the info below and the attached pictures.  The owner of this residence and adjacent 3 plus acres will be moving into a Nursing Home and is extremely interested in selling this to the park.  The tax value is $131K; I asked her how much she was looking for and she said about $200K.  \r\n\r\nThe location is almost perfect for a Ranger residence for the Boulders/Cleveland County portion of the park.  It is right across the street from the gate and honestly looks like it is a park residence or office.  The house is a 3 bedroom/2 bath, about 1600 square feet, and the HVAC was updated about 4 years ago according to Ms. Savage (the owner).  My only concerns are the small kitchen area and the relatively small living room.  The bedrooms, though, are quite big.  Everything looks extremely well built (done by a community college class) and well maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\nI explained our appraisal process and how we go about this.  She is also interested in getting it appraised.  I told her we normally use local appraisers for our appraisals. Donâ€™t know if it makes sense, but it we could recommend an appraiser to her we might be able to use their info for any future negotiation.  She understands it will take some time to work this out, but she would need to know if we are seriously considering it. Ms. Savage said she has at least one party interested in purchasing the place.\r\n\r\nWe might also want to consider this for a rental cabin to produce revenue.\r\n\r\nIf we pursued this for a park residence I would recommend the SSP Ranger residence at 1352 Sparrow Springs Road no longer be used as a Ranger residence since it is less than 800 square feet and has only two bedrooms.  That house could be used for rentals, interns, seasonals, out of town park guests etc.  Just something to think about.\r\n\r\nCan yâ€™all talk about this at the next Ops Mtg. and let me know if we are interested in this?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Zoom To Hide Highlight Clear\r\n\r\nOwner: SAVAGE MOLLY FENNELL\r\nGIS Deeded Acres: 3.079\r\nCalculated Acres: 2.90126806\r\nZoning: Restricted Residential\r\n________________________________________\r\nParcel No.: 49609\r\nPIN: 2592452456\r\nParcel Address: 105 VANDYKE RD\r\nOther Address(es):\r\n105 VANDYKE RD\r\nPrior Year\'s Owner: SAVAGE MOLLY FENNELL\r\n   105 VAN DYKE RD\r\n   KINGS MOUNTAIN NC 28086\r\nMap: 4-84 Blk: 1 Lot: 56\r\nDeed Book: 1269 Pg: 2484\r\nLand Area: 3.079 acres\r\nTax Values:\r\nBuilding Value:	$99,839\r\nLand Value:	$31,629\r\nTotal Value:	$131,468\r\n\r\nView Property Card\r\nView Parcel History\r\n\r\nParcel History\r\n1 complete transfers or combines.\r\nParcel Number	Parent Number	Owner Name	Deed Reference	Trans action Type	Trans action Date\r\n49609	49604	SAVAGE MOLLY FENNELL	1269 2484	XFR	7/29/2004\r\n0 splits.\r\nView Ledger Sheet - 4-84.pdf\r\nMailable Link (right-click to copy)\r\nView in GoogleEarth/Download KML\r\nView in GoogleMaps\r\n________________________________________\r\nAttributes at point: N: 525519, E: 1294309\r\nZoning\r\n 	Class:	Restricted Residential\r\n 	Municipality:	Cleveland County Zoning\r\n\r\n\r\nLarry Hyde, Park Superintendent\r\nCrowders Mountain State Park\r\n522 Park Office Lane\r\nKings Mountain, NC 28086\r\n704.853.5375\r\n704.853.5391 (Fax)\r\nlarry.hyde@ncparks.gov\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE NEW E-MAIL ADDRESS!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail correspondence to and from this address is subject to\r\n\r\nthe North Carolina Public Records Law and may be disclosed\r\n\r\nto third parties unless the content is exempt by statute or\r\n\r\nother regulation.\r\n\r\n','CHOP REVIEWING','','','electronic','EMAIL 4/2/15 CHOP CORRESP','complete','','',',file_upload/2015_04/105_Van_Dyke_Front_View.jpg,file_upload/2015_04/CRMO_Savage_Property.pdf,file_upload/2015_04/CRMO_Potential_Park_Residence_or_Rental_Cabin.msg','','2015-08-03 16:20:16','Williams5894'),(3155,'Administration','2015-04-02','','DIR','Murphy','','SCORP Notebook and correspondence for van der Vaart and Gov McCrory for LWCF','to Pugh','','4/2/15','paper','','complete','','','','','2015-04-16 20:57:04','Eikinas5239'),(3156,'APC','2015-04-03','','','Kelly Chandler','APC','Final APC Agenda-  see file folder on desktop because files are too large.

The Councilâ€™s goals are to promote communication and partnership within the Division; develop Division-wide standards for various administrative procedures; and promote and provide educational and training opportunities for the DPR administrative professional staff.  The Council consists of administrative professionals from across the Division.rnrnThe APC hosted its first administrative training seminar in 2006.  From the beginning, one of the most important goals of the trainings was to provide office assistants with an opportunity to meet with their peers and discuss issues with others who share common concerns.  Over the years, APC training sessions have included instruction in the areas of budget, purchasing, accounting, HR issues, DPR databases, and IT concerns.  DPR staff, APC members, and guest speakers have covered job-related topics such as tips for SAP GUI users, ethics in the workplace, customer service, concessions, and the Central Reservation System.  Staff from various DPR programs and sections have provided an overview of their duties in order to offer the Office Assistants a view into how those areas function.  Exhibits staff have offered mini workshops on Photoshop and PowerPoint, and I&E staff have provided welcome breaks during our trainings in the form of ice breaker activities and hikes.  Database training sessions are almost always on the agenda, in order to stay abreast of new databases or updates.rnrnAPC trainings have proven to be beneficial not only to administrative assistants, but to any of our staff whose day-to-day job includes administrative duties.  Many rangers and superintendents have attended APC training sessions in an effort to improve their knowledge of administrative functions.rnrnIn addition to planning and hosting trainings, the APC has been instrumental in the creation and development of several Division databases.  We have also worked to standardize budgetary, purchasing, personnel, and other administrative procedures throughout the Division.  A recent addition is an APC newsletter, created to provide useful information for administrative professionals. We try to highlight upcoming events and training opportunities, offer a look at what in going on in our parks, recognize new faces and those who are retiring, and provide helpful tips and ideas that relate to our jobs as representatives for North Carolina State Parks.  rnrnIn short, we provide support for state parks office assistants. But we can only be effective in our endeavors with your feedback.  We welcome suggestions, comments and questions, and are always interested in recruiting new administrative professionals to join the APC.

PDF converter will open as a pdf, jpg image, eps file and expect more to be added. A copy of Meredith\'s email and instructions are also uploaded if needed. I will email to all members of the council. EPS FILE-Encapsulated Postscript Vector graphics (Adobe Illustrator) EPS is a file extension for a graphics file format used in vector-based images in Adobe Illustrator. EPS stands for Encapsulated PostScript. An EPS file can contain text as well as graphics. PNG FILE-PNG (pronounced ping as in ping-pong; for Portable Network Graphics) is a file format for image compression that, in time, is expected to replace the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) that is widely used on today\'s Internet. JPG FILE-JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group. (.JPG file extension, pronounced Jay Peg). This is the right format for those photo images which must be very small files, for example, for web sites or for email. JPG is often used on digital camera memory cards, but RAW or TIF format may be offered too, to avoid it.\r\n\r\nRouting comments: Good afternoon Denise, Attached below is a APC Logo Guide, it explains what Iâ€™ve attached in the â€œAPC Final Logo\" zip file. It specifies uses for the particular formats and gives you the colors and fonts used in the logo. If you have any question, please feel free to contact me. As I mentioned, Friday is my last day before my month off. In that time, if you need any other format, Marla knows where I have the files. Hope you all enjoy your new logo!

I will upload a copy to the APC correspondence file too.  Use this for meetings and events you attend and on behalf of the APC for any overnight travel that meets the  requirements for meetings, etc.  Keep a copy of travel guidelines handy so you know what the times of departure/arrival and overnight charges can occur with your overnight travel status when you submit reimbursement.  You would also furnish a copy of this TA if you use the parking deck at the NRC and for lunch if you meet the time from duty station requirements and return requirements.  This will cover guests like Tom Howard, Maria, Karen, etc. if needed for a training or event not covered by requested APC TA from Denise.\r\n\r\nIf I prepare a Training TA then you are automatically covered under the training event TA and would furnish an approved copy of it instead of the Blanket APC TA attached.

A couple of the parks visitation may seem lower this year compared to 2015 and that can be contributed to rainy weather on a few 2016 weekends and also in 2015 we had (5) full weekends to visit the parks compared to the (4) for this year.

Generally winter weather closures require the use of the Adverse Weather form (attached) and not the Emergency Closing form.  Below are the conditions we have been following to determine whether or not to send a notification form. Please continue follow these practices until we are told otherwise.rnrnâ€¢	The forms need to be submitted anytime there is a park closure lasting more than one day. Delayed openings (starting and ending on the same day) do not require a notification form.rnâ€¢	If one area of your park is closed but others remain open, submit a notification form; but be specific as to what is closing and what remains open.rnâ€¢	Submit one notification form for each event.  So, if it snows on a Tuesday and you don\'t re-open until Friday, you only need to submit one form for all four days and not four different forms.rnâ€¢	If the end date and time is unknown, please enter \"Estimated\" and give the estimated date and time that the park will re-open.  Don\'t wait to re-open before submitting the notification form. rnâ€¢	If you have an extended, ongoing closure, please submit an updated form weekly.  rnâ€¢	If you open for a day and then close again, you will need to submit separate forms.   So, if your park is closed Monday and Tuesday, open on Wednesday and then closed again on Thursday and Friday, you would submit two forms (one for Monday & Tuesday and another for Thursday and Friday).rnâ€¢	When you submit these forms, please save it with the following file name: (PARK ACRONYM) Notification of Adverse Weather Closing (yearmonthday) ex. MOMI Notification of Adverse Weather Closing 20170106rnâ€¢	Please note below, that these forms should be emailed directly to Adrian Oâ€™Neal, Beverly Blue, Denise Williams and now Sheila Brown and continue to copy both Julie Bunn and myself.rnrnSome other things to think of in preparation of the of winter storms.rnrnâ€¢	Do you have scrape blades attached to the tractors/skid steers/trucks?rnâ€¢	Are the above placed in strategic locations to be available for clearing and do the persons who will be on site to operate have the keys?rnâ€¢	Chainsaws ready in case trees come down?  Do on-site rangers have them at home?rnâ€¢	Generators ready and in place for power losses?rnâ€¢	Gas cans filled?rnâ€¢	For those of you who treat roads, equipment and brine ready to put down in advance of the snow?rnâ€¢	â€œSnow Meltâ€ granules available and ready to put down on key walkways in advance?rnâ€¢	Staff have shovels in their trucks?rnâ€¢	Are tire chains in the trucks that need them and do staff know how to put them on?rnâ€¢	Radio batteries charged?rnâ€¢	Residential rangers have water stored for drinking and flushing?rnâ€¢	Do non-residential staff know their status regarding reporting to work and know who and how to notify if they are not coming into work?  In most cases they should not report unless confident that road conditions and their mode of transportation will allow it.rnâ€¢	If you will not be at the park, does the acting superintendent know the notification procedures?rnâ€¢	Do campers and other guests know the situation, their options, and recognize that if they stay they may not be able to leave when they want?rnrnRemember our visitors often enjoy seeing the parks in the snow.  Please make every effort to open your parks when it is safe to do so.  Please remind your staff to be careful.  Do all your work deliberately and with caution, always thinking about footing, slowing down your driving speed, and with an eye toward breaking branches and falling trees above.rnrnIf you cannot open fully, concentrate on partial openings to allow parking for hikers, photographers and other users who can get there safely.  Opening in stages is a good plan.rnrnPlease notify Julie and I of your parkâ€™s status and update the website as soon as is reasonable, even if it is before you can submit the notification form.  Let us know if there are any questions or concerns.rnrnrnSeanrnrnrnrnrnrnrnrnrnSean McElhonernMountain Region SuperintendentrnNC Division of Parks and Recreationrnsean.mcelhone@ncparks.govrn704-528-6514 x216rnrn rnrn              	rnEmail correspondence to and from this address is subject to the North Carolina Public Records Law rnand may be disclosed to third parties unless the content is exempt by statute or other regulation.rnrnFrom: Blue, Beverly [mailto:beverly.blue@ncparks.gov] rnSent: Thursday, January 21, 2016 3:05 PMrnTo: NCDENR.denr.dpr.district-supts <denr.dpr.district-supts@lists.ncmail.net>; NCDENR.denr.dpr-all-supts <denr.dpr-all-supts@lists.ncmail.net>; Dowdy, Bryan <bryan.dowdy@ncparks.gov>; Howerton, Jerry <jerry.howerton@ncparks.gov>rnCc: Quinn, Sherry <sherry.quinn@ncparks.gov>; Williams, Denise <denise.williams@ncparks.gov>; Oneal, Adrian <adrian.oneal@ncparks.gov>; Mitchener, Valerie M <valerie.mitchener@ncparks.gov>; Jeeter, Carl <carl.jeeter@ncparks.gov>; HADFIELD, CARA A <cara.hadfield@ncparks.gov>rnSubject: FW: HR Administrative Memorandum: Adverse Weather Leave and Emergency ClosingrnImportance: HighrnrnGood Afternoon DPR Superintendents,rnrnPlease see the below message.

A reminder email message has been distributed to all employee regarding the Adverse Weather Leave Policy.rnrnPlease be reminded that an emergency closing is designated by the Secretary based upon a recommendation of the Division. This is required to close the site as well as for employees to be eligible for the time allowed under the Emergency Closing policy. Otherwise, Adverse Weather Leave applies. rnrnSpecifically, the following guidelines are to be followed for emergency closings:rn1.	An email request or phone call shall be made to Kevin Cherry to route to the Secretary to close a site.  The recommendation of the Division and reasons shall be included.  It is important to specify in the recommendation whether there is a need to close a location â€œto the public onlyâ€ which employees would follow the Adverse Weather Leave policy, or â€œto close the site entirelyâ€ which employees would follow the Emergency Closing policy.  Dr. Cherry will release the Secretaryâ€™s decision.rn2.	If a location is closed by the Secretary, the division shall forward Tammy Penny (tammy.penny@ncdcr.gov) and Laurie McVey (laurie.mcvey@ncdcr.gov), Benefits and Development Manager, the Notification of Emergency Closing form to be submitted to the Office of State Human Resources (OSHR).

No suspect asbestos containing materials were detected during the inspection, however, it should be noted that there is a possibility of the existence of asbestos containing materials concealed inside the walls, under floors ect. since this residence has been renovated since its construction.   \r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nDwayne A.
