<?php$HARI="\n\nAuthorized by the General Assembly in 2003, the Haw River State Park is in the early stages of development for future public use. The first major acquisition for the state park was the Summit Center, a Retreat and Conference Center originally owned by the Episcopal Diocese.  This facility is now operated as the division's first residential environmental education center and also provides conference facilities which can be rented for group activities.\n\nLocated near the headwaters of the Haw River, The Haw River State Park and Summit Environmental Education Center is situated on nearly 300 acres of piedmont forest, fields, wetlands, and uplands.\n\nAs land acquisition continues and Haw River State Park grows and develops the park will be able to provide additional resource protection of the Haw River Corridor and recreational opportunities for park visitors.  We hope to include picnicking, camping, and hiking opportunities in the future.  The Haw River Corridor is also a proposed route for the Mountains to Sea Trail.\n\nUntil additional properties are acquired for the state park, we do not have facilities for general public use.  Visitors are welcome to come to visit and see what we are all about, but it is recommended that you call ahead: our operating hours are Monday -- Friday 8am to 5pm and we are closed most state holidays.  If the Summit is reserved for a weekend group, we will open during those reservation hours. We also ask that visitors check in at the front desk before touring the grounds.";?>
