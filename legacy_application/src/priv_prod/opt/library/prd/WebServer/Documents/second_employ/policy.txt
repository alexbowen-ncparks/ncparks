The employment <b>responsibilities to the State are primary</b> for any employee working full-time; any other employment in which that person chooses to engage <b>is secondary</b>.  An employee shall have approval from the agency head before engaging in any secondary employment.  The purpose of this approval procedure is to determine that the secondary employment does not have an adverse effect on the primary employment and does not create a conflict of interest.  These provisions for secondary employment apply to all employment not covered by the policy on Dual Employment.
<br /><br />
Secondary employment shall not be permitted when it would:
 <br />
*	create either directly or indirectly a conflict of interest with the primary employment, or<br />
*	impair in any way the employee’s ability to perform all expected duties, to make decisions and carry out in an objective fashion the responsibilities of the employee’s position.
<br /><br />
Approval for secondary employment may be withdrawn at any time if it is determined that secondary employment has an adverse impact on primary employment.
