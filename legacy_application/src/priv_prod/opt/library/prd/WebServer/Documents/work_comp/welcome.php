<br /><br /><font color='red'>Effective January 1st 2020, the state of NC has a new third party administrator for workers’ comp.  </font>
	<br /><br /><b>Standard WC forms will continue to be required as usual</b>; however, the database is designed to help reduce submission of incomplete forms which delay entry of WC claims into the CCMSI database in a timely manner.  The online application will prompt you to enter specific data required to complete each form.  The goal is to increase efficiency and productivity.<br /><br />
You are encouraged to submit comments to DPR Human Resources to enhance the functionality of the  new WC database.<br /><br />

FROM:            Tammy D. Penny, HR Director<br /><br />TO:                  DNCR Division Directors<br /><br />SUBJECT:      Notification Process for Injured Employees<br /><br />The following guidance is provided in order to clarify accident reporting requirements for employees injured in on-the-job accidents/incidents:<br /><br />For all DNCR employees or staff members who are injured and require medical treatment at a hospital <b>and not</b> in an Urgent Care/Clinic, Supervisors and/or HR Managers <b>must notify DNCR Safety Consultants and/or the DNCR Worker’s Compensation Manager as soon as possible</b> but not later than 4-6 hours following the incident.  This includes minor injuries if the employee is taken to a <b>hospital</b> for evaluation/treatment.  The distinction is where the employee is seen, Hospital vs. Urgent Care.  Hospital visits have more time sensitive reporting requirements than Urgent Care visits.<br /><br />By notifying Safety and Worker’s Comp quickly we can ensure the injured employee receives prompt care for their injury and that DNCR is compliant with OSHR and NC DOL reporting requirements.<br /><br /><b>DNCR Safety, Health and Worker’s Comp Contact Information</b></br>            Telephone                               Email<br />Laurie McVey, Worker’s Comp Mgr.
