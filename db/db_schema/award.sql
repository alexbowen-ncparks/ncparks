The 24 hour event, starting at 4:00 p.m. included musical and educational programs in addition to the opening of the new NRC exhibits for the public of more than 70,000 visitors.  State Capitol Police and North Carolina state park staff assisted in the shared role of managing incident command/security for the event along with museum staff.  I, Karl Erik Nygard, NC State Parks, North District Superintendent, was stationed at the Incident Command Center and witnessed the immediate response unfold that resulted in the saving the life of a DENR contract employee. \r\n\r\nFrom Eno River State Park Superintendent Nealsonâ€™s report of the incident: \r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 2012 at approximately 16:20 hours (4:20 p.m.), I, Superintendent Keith Nealson, was on duty at the front desk of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences during the grand opening of the Nature Research Center (NRC).  Chief of Security Andrea Judd came running by, saying that she had an emergency somewhere in the building, a possible cardiac arrest.  She ran outside the building and I ran with her.  She encountered Officer Pender with State Capital Police and then the three of us ran back into the building and were joined by NC State Park Ranger Neal Ward.  Andrea had Officer Pender grab an AED and the four of us took the elevator to sub level B.  We proceeded to a maintenance area of that level where we found a NC Museum of Natural Sciences contract employee (name removed) unconscious and unresponsive on the ground.  A fellow employee was also there with the employee and he had witnessed the initial incident.  He stated that a few minutes earlier the contract employee had been leaning on a cart, had gotten shaky on his feet and had collapsed to the floor.  His eyes were open and he was attempting to breathe in short gasps every few seconds.  His face was beginning to turn cyanotic.  Ranger Ward and Officer Pender began a primary assessment.  His pulse was very weak and thready.\r\n\r\nAndrea Judd ran back up stairs to direct EMT personnel down.    I advised Officer Pender, State Capitol Police and Ranger Ward to remove the employee\'s shirt and undershirt.  I readied the AED.  Based on the fact that his breathing attempts were getting more and more sporadic and shallower it seemed likely that he was getting worse. \r\n\r\nWe attached the AED pads and the machine began to analyze the patient at about the same time that the employee appeared to stop breathing completely.  At this same time the first two EMTs from Wake County EMS showed up.  This was approximately 16:27 hours. (4:27 p.m.)   The AED advised to administer a shock to the employee, so Ranger Ward and I advised everyone to stand clear and I administered one shock.  One EMT began chest compressions.  The other EMT told Ranger Ward and I to operate a bag valve mask on the employee while she removed the pads from the AED we had used and put pads from her AED on the patient. \r\n\r\nRanger Ward and I operated the bag valve mask for the next several minutes while Wake County EMS did compressions.  Supplemental oxygen was added to the BVM by Wake County EMS.  During this time at least one more shock was administered and the employee again appeared to be trying to intake breathes at a very slow rate- about 2-3 breathes a minute.  After a few minutes we were relieved by Wake County EMS staff who continued to work on the employee.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 16:36 hours Ranger Ward and I stood down and spent a few minutes giving facts as we knew them to EMTs and to State Capitol Police.  By this time there was enough staff on hand that we were not needed for traffic control or for scene security.  The EMT staff put the employee on a stretcher and he was taken out the elevator loading dock at approximately 16:43 hours.  Ranger Ward and I cleared the scene at 16:45 hours (4:45 p.m.).\r\n\r\nOn April 23rd I contacted one of the contract employee\'s co-workers who informed me that he had been taken to the hospital and spent part of the weekend in a coma but that he had recovered from that and, as of the morning of the 23rd, he was awake and verbally responsive.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Nealson and Ranger Ward acted quickly, without hesitation, in a professional manner to assist in a team effort with an officer which they had never trained to save a DENR contract employeeâ€™s life. It is apparent that the immediate and professional actions taken by Superintendent Nealson, Ranger Ward lead to the survival of the individual.

By this time there was enough staff on hand that we were not needed for traffic control or for scene security.  The EMT staff put the employee on a stretcher and he was taken out the elevator loading dock at approximately 16:43 hours.  Ranger Ward and I cleared the scene at 16:45 hours (4:45 p.m.).\r\n\r\nOn April 23rd I contacted one of the contract employee\'s co-workers who informed me that he had been taken to the hospital and spent part of the weekend in a coma but that he had recovered from that and, as of the morning of the 23rd, he was awake and verbally responsive.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Nealson and Ranger Ward acted quickly, without hesitation, in a professional manner to assist in a team effort with an officer which they had never trained to save a DENR contract employeeâ€™s life. It is apparent that the immediate and professional actions taken by Superintendent Nealson, Ranger Ward lead to the survival of the individual.   Nealson and Wardâ€™s dedication to public service, the execution of their responsibilities and the compassion shown by their actions deserves recognition.','erik.nygard@ncdenr.gov','919-841-4059','','ENRI','NODI','','2012-10-05','','This Award was submitted simultaneously by Eric Dousharm from FALA.

Both Fred and Kay were founding members of the Gaston Conservation Society (Fred was the first and only treasurer).  The Gaston Conservation Society was a group instrumental in the early 1970s to protecting the park in perpetuity.  Fred and Kay were founding members of the Friends of Crowders Mountain, Inc. at its inception in 2000, and have been members since.  Fred has served as treasurer and both have served as Board members and continue to do so.  Fred and Kay have also personally funded projects at the park, including a $500 donation to revitalize the butterfly garden at the Visitor Center.   Quick story: at one Friends meeting I discussed our desire to purchase a park residence near the Boulders Access Area, which was listed for $185,000.  I mentioned that the homeowners were motivated to sell the house quickly, but that the state procedure for purchasing a house would take over one year.  Fred called me that evening and offered to pay for the house himself if we needed it quickly.   Kay has also worked and volunteered at the Schiele Museum, a city of Gastonia nature museum that the park partners with to provide I and E programs to the community.  Kay also worked with a small educational group to receive a $250 grant, used to present teacher workshops called â€œDiscovering Crowders Mountain,â€ a predecessor to the divisionâ€™s EELE program. Kay has provided programs at Friends meetings, our annual fall festival, and informally to Ranger staff.\r\n  \r\n\r\nProbably the most impressive character trait seen in both Fred and Kay is their ability to adapt to the changes both to the park and the Friends group.  Fred and Kay have been willing and able to use their past experience, but also look to the future, to provide valuable leadership to the Friends of Crowders Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                        \r\nI have nominated Fred and Kay collectively because, although they are two individuals with separate opinions and personalities, they work together in harmony to help CRMO keep the NC State Parkâ€™s mission statement in focus.!\r\n','larry.hyde@ncdenr.gov','704.853.5375','','CRMO','WEDI','','2012-10-08','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Hyde9290,Hyde9290,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Howard6319,Howard6319,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Tillotson5212,Shimel1060,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','uploads/2012/AN_004_other_file_3_1380.doc',''),(5,'AN_005','2012','Award Presentation Complete','3','Lewis Wood','Mr. Lewis Wood is an original member of the Hanging Rock State Park Advisory Committee.  Since his appointment he has been a faithful and involved participant on the committee.  In 2005 Lewis instituted a project to bolster interpretation and education funding for Hanging Rock that has reaped exceptional results.  Lewis began making walking sticks and donating them to the park.   In a time consuming process he cuts saplings on his own property, cuts them to length, and sands them down.  He has several finishing processes.   Some sticks are done stripping the bark and left plain and others include burning patterns in the wood.   He coats the stripped sticks with urethane at his own expense.  He leaves the bark on selected species and whittles patterns in the bark.  To meet varying tastes Lewis drills a hole in some sticks and adds a leather wrist thong to the grip.  The most popular walking sticks are those that are twisted from a vine growing on them which require much care in de-barking.  Lewis brings stacks of sticks to the park several times a year which are then put on display.  Park visitors may have a walking stick if they put $10 in the park donation box, far below the going price for handmade sticks.  The donation box money goes to fund exhibits, literature, taxidermy, and supplies for the park interpretation and education efforts.  The sticks are enormously popular and the park cannot keep up with demand.  Children in particular want a Lewis Wood walking stick before they start out on the hiking trails.  In seven years Lewis has donated more than 400 walking sticks, which translates into more than $4000.00 for interpretation and education.   At the same time he has brought joy to hundreds of park visitors who left the park with their own Hanging Rock walking stick, serving as a reminder every time they use it of the good time they had at the park.','dave.cook@ncdenr.gov','(336)593-8480','','HARO','NODI','','2012-10-11','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Cook4712,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Tillotson5212,Tillotson5212,Shimel1060,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(6,'AN_006','2012','Award Presentation Complete','5','Adam Carver','On August 1, 2008 at 12:05 Falls Lake Rangers Dave Mumford, Adam Carver and Former Ranger Paula Horstman responded by boat to a report of a man face Down in the water.  he had fallen from a jet ski.

In 1966 a group of concerned citizens gathered together to lobby against the idea of making a reservoir out of the Eno River.  Because of their efforts, in 1973 Governor Holshouser welcomed the Eno River State Park into the state parksâ€™ system.  It is likely that without the efforts of the Association, Eno River State Park would never have come into existence at all.\r\n\r\n	For the last four decades or so the Association has continued to support efforts to preserve and protect land along the entire Eno River, including Eno River State Park.  They have made so many things possible for the state park.  They have negotiated land deals, obtained conservation easements, and spent countless volunteer hours working in or near park lands.  Last year one of their employees took up the challenge of serving as lead contact for the parkâ€™s trail steward volunteer program.  His efforts allow park staff to concentrate on other volunteer efforts in the park.  \r\n\r\nThe Associationâ€™s efforts at educating the public have often intertwined with the parkâ€™s staff efforts, as we partner up for events like the New Years Day Hike, the Eno River Festival, and the iWalk the Eno educational camps each year.  They advertise our programs along with their programs and we do the same.  In this way we both reach the largest user group and thus maximize the educational opportunities.\r\n\r\n      It is very likely that the 1,000 acre Dubose tract added to the park in 2007 would not have happened without the assistance of the Association.  They helped in communications and survey fees.  In 2010 the Scarlett/Oâ€™dell heirs property, a 23 acre piece of property became available.  Because of the way it had been bequeathed to the family, 28 different people officially owned a piece of it and had to sign off on the sale.  The Association handled all the delicate negotiations and paperwork on this deal, realizing that the state did not have the necessary time to devote to it.  We were able to acquire this critical â€˜missing puzzle pieceâ€™ for river protection  because of their efforts.   As recently as 2011 the Association aided the park by purchasing a one acre parcel of land (the Links property) that was needed to complete a portion of the Mountains-to-sea Trail in the park.  They held the land while the necessary money was found and then sold it back to the state, insuring its future use as protected public land. \r\n\r\n	In the interest of full disclosure it should be noted that the Board of Directors of the Association does serve as the Eno River State Parkâ€™s Advisory committee.  But the Association itself is a stand alone certified Public Land Trust and 501c3 organization.  It has a separate mission statement and separate priorities from the park. It just so happens that their priorities and the parkâ€™s priorities mesh in a myriad of wonderful ways.\r\nThe Association is a partner to the park in so many ways that I think their dedication deserves this special recognition.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n-Sincerely,\r\n\r\nKeith Nealson\r\n\r\ncontact person for award-  ROBIN JACOBS, robin@enoriver.org or 919 620-9099 xt 202\r\n','keith.nealson@ncdenr.gov','(919) 383 1686','','ENRI','NODI','','2012-10-16','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Nealson7511,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Tillotson5212,Shimel1060,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(12,'AN_012','2013','Award Presentation Complete','2','Jackie Cullipher','Angelia,                                                                              \r\n\r\nIn 2007 when the Red Fox really became a problem at FOFI staff knew something had to be done.  Former PASU Sean Mcelhone came up with an idea to get animal proof trash cans for the park.  This was a great idea and metal bins were ordered from Correction Enterprises and delivered to FOFI in June of 2007.  While a good plan these metal bins could not tolerate a salt water environment and were rusting out within a year.\r\n\r\nThese metal cans are extremely expensive.  In 2007 a single refuse bin was 484.35 a piece and a multiple can bin was 765.00.   The park purchased 4 multiple bins and 4 single ones the bill was 4,997.40.  That invoice is attached. Today the multiple bin is 955.00 a piece.  In 2009 I knew that these bins had to be replaced.  What should we do?  Go back with the same and get less than 2 years out of them or take another route.\r\n\r\nJackie Cullipher , former maintenance mechanic Mark Lawson and myself sat down and decided that we thought we could make these bins out of wood.  So the process began and animal proof bins were built very similar to the ones Corrections builds.  A great advantage of these bins however is they are light enough for one person to maneuver but yet still animal proof, with the exception of a bear which we currently donâ€™t have at FOFI.  As we roll into 2013 this will be the fourth summer using these bins.  They have held up extremely well and all bins that have been built are still in use.  We were also able to paint these bins and they match the exterior of the building making things look uniform.\r\n\r\nThe best part however is the money that has been saved.  The single bins are made from a single sheet of plywood and the multiple bins take two.  Other materials needed include hinges, screws, hooks and eye, bolts for the hinges, paint and 2 4X4â€™s.  When we built these it cost us 50.00 for a single bin and about 100.00 for the multiple one.  Many times we simply use scrap wood left over from other projects. Currently we have 18 single bins which cost us about 900.00 and one 3 bin container that cost about 100.00 .  So currently we have about 1000.00 dollars invested into all of these cans!!!  Look back at 2007 we had 8 total at 4,997.40.  That is a cost savings for the division of 3,997.40.  Today with costs rising letâ€™s say its 75 a single and 150 a multiple one.  This will still result in huge savings.  Also again we are going into our fourth year with these bins and the only thing that has been redone is painting. (42.00 dollars for 5 gallons not bad).  If we stayed with the metal we would be on our third set right now. Yikes!\r\n\r\nJack and Jessica even added a modification this year, which is where the hooks and eye come into place.  We started noticing that if the bins were extremely full the bag would tear while getting it out.  So now each bin has a â€œfront doorâ€ that can be removed to easily pull the bag out.\r\n\r\nThese bins are now being built and used at CABE.  I believe they are also going to be discussed at this yearâ€™s Maintenance Conference.  Just wanted to pass on this great cost savings measure at FOFI!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\nJeffrey T.Owen\r\nPark Superintendent \r\nFort Fisher State Recreation Area\r\n1000 Loggerhead Road\r\nKure Beach, NC 28449\r\n(910) 458-5798\r\nJeffrey.Owen@ncparks.gov\r\n','angelia.allcox@ncparks.gov','919-841-4058','Committee recognizes the hard work of all park staff, but see the real value in the development of the new style bin and the the committee recomends the award go to Jackie Cullipher as the designer and constructor of this project.','SODI','SODI','','2013-02-19','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Allcox9961,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Williams5894,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','uploads/2013/AN_012_other_file_1_7817.JPG','uploads/2013/AN_012_other_file_3_6966.pdf','uploads/2013/AN_012_other_file_4_4355.JPG'),(13,'AN_013','2013','Award Presentation Complete','5','Kevin Bleck','On October 26, 2012, Ranger Kevin Bleck responded to incident of a 36 year old male having seizures in the Picnic Area.

Roosevelt, called by many as our countryâ€™s CONSERVATIONIST PRESIDENT would embark on an administration that would see the creation of the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service as we know it today. Under Teddy Roosevelt, citizens from all walks of life would begin to enjoy the beauty and splendor of places such as Crater Lake in Oregon, Wind Cove in South Dakota, Sullys Hill in neighboring North Dakota, Mesa Verde in Colorado and the Platt region of Oklahoma. Roosevelt recognized manâ€™s connection to his natural environment and used his bully pulpit to ensure that future generations would not be denied the pleasure of enjoying natural unspoiled lands. When the two-term president left office in 1909, his actions helped preserve and keep in the public domain more than 230 million acres. Six years later, many environmentally conscience North Carolinians channeled their energies and passion to create Mount Mitchell State Park beginning an endeavor that would grow to 35 state parks and four recreational areas throughout the state. The value of our state parks is not lost on the citizens and visitors who patronize our beautiful preserves. The tourists and guests who decide to visit have a profound impact on the local economies in which these parks are located. According to the Governorâ€™s office, outdoor recreation in North Carolina annually contributes $19.2 billion to our states economy with more than $400 million coming into state coffers as a direct result of people visiting our state parks. Now fast forward six decades or so, In the early 1970s, a young boy and his family began to call Swansboro home. Like many families, they were brought here by the military. Our Man of the Year would matriculate in its public schools and graduate from Swansboro High School in 1982. He would continue his higher learning by studying Computer Programming at Coastal Carolina Community College. While similar men such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellision were already involved in the same field of study and would help revolutionize the way we live, our man of the year embarked on a path of community service and public advocacy that some would argue had as much effect on those who he touched as the computer nerd drop outs from Harvard and denizens of Silicon Valley. In practically every organization in which he became affiliated, he not only became deeply involved but attained positions of leadership. In 1988, six years after graduating high school, he was accepted into the Swansboro Rotary, a civic group that states its members place service above self. He would attain leadership positions of secretary, Vice President and eventually President. He would expand his Rotarian reach when he became Assistant District Governor for Rotary International District 7730 for three years. He valued public service and ran for a seat on the town board. He was elected Swansboro Town Commissioner in 1997 serving one term. He held leadership positions on the board of directors of the Jacksonville Board of Realtors serving as its President in 1999. He gave back to his alma mater by serving on the board and being its president of the Swansboro High School Century Club from 2003 to 2012. He currently serves on the Swansboro Tourism Development Authority as well as on the Sea Turtle Advisory Committee. And of course, he is a fellow chamber member. But it was a seemingly innocuous boat ride with his wife by his side and Park Superintendent Sam Bland on board that led to our Man of the Year into getting involved knee deep in the comings and goings of Hammocks Beach State Park when he innocently asked how do things get done here. In so many words during a short 15-minute cruise to the unspoiled barrier island, Bland simply stated, â€œthe squeaky wheel gets the grease.â€ Bland had no idea what those six words ignited inside our Man of the Year. From that day forward, he has been applying the lubricant. I bet there isnâ€™t a member of our Stateâ€™s Senate or General Assembly who has been within earshot of him who isnâ€™t aware by now his passion for the Hammocks Beach State Park and its pristine sand dunes, changing channels and beloved sea turtles. And Iâ€™ll read word for word from outline written about our Man of the Year as provided to me by the woman who knows him bestâ€”his wife: â€œHe has worked tirelessly to protect the remaining 289 acres of the Hammocks Beach Corporation from being developed and advocated for the property to become part of HBSP.â€ The irony in those words is that our Man of the Yearâ€™s 9 to 5 job is that of a Swansboro real estate agent who in most situations would love nothing more than to have more waterfront property come onto the market. But I believe our Man of the Year has other reasons why he chooses to preserve this land. I bet heâ€™s doing for future generations. Perhaps for the two young ladies seated next to him tonight. For when daughters Jessica and Kristen, both Swansboro girls and alumna of Wake Forest, return home years later with their families and enjoy a day on Bear Island they can tell their children, â€œyour grand daddy helped preserve this local treasure.â€ Jessica and Kristen, please join me and your mother Pam in presenting your father David as the Swansboro Area Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year.

For the last 19 years she has served as a part time weekend office assistant and a very frequent volunteer for the park.  She has handed out information, told stories, and managed campers and other reservations.  She has greeted each customer with a smile and a good attitude. During the week when the full time office assistant asked for time off Jane would frequently volunteer to come in and work for no pay, and during her time in the park she has logged in more than 1,500 volunteer hours. (It is likely more than that-  Jane often didn\'t fill out the volunteer sheet, saying that she was not doing this kind of thing for recognition).  \r\nJane has helped to develop and maintain infomational materials for the public.  Jane has always maintained a level of professionalism far above the normal expectations. She has served as a fountain of wisdom about the people and places throughout the park, a local historian who regaled the staff and park visitors with entertaining stories about the cultural history of the area.  In many ways Jane has been the heart and soul of the park.\r\nJane is in her eighties and failing health has caused her to have to tender her resignation.  She still wants to volunteer, but the idea of her being alone in the office has her worried that she might not be able to provide sufficient customer service.  She made it clear in her letter of resignation that she was resigning for the sake of the park\'s well being, not hers. I am absolutely sure that this is the truth, as she has always put the interests of the park she loves above her own.\r\nI think it would be an absolute shame not to recognize this fine woman for 19 years of dedicated service to Eno River State park and to the citizens of and visitors to North Carolina.\r\n','keith.nealson@ncparks.gov','9193831686','It would be helpful to see examples of the informational materials Mrs. Umstead developed for the park.

Keith Nealson leads by example, with his work ethic and his professionalism.  He has and will continue to be my mentor because of the way he chooses to interact with staff and customers of state parks.  He is a testament to using his words to solve difficult issues which includes low staffing issues and how it affects trail maintenance.  He developed a program through our Park committee, the Eno River Association, called Trail stewards.  One week a month, the Trail Stewards work as small teams, hike trails and to do small maintenance on park trails.  They contact the park staff members who are responsible for specific trails when they see a hazard, which enables park staff to assess and handle problems quickly and efficiently. Keith Nealson wrote up a guideline for this group and made it happen.  Twice this year, he has conducted a training to teach these volunteers and maintain best practices to ensure safe work while they are in the park.  This program leads patrons of the park to build a personal relationship with the park and also ensures our mission statement of operating state parks that provide recreational use of natural resources and outdoor recreation in natural surroundings. \r\nAnother example of his leadership of Eno River State Park is the construction of a comfortable work environment that allows his staff to excel at their strengths and improve on their weaknesses.  Nealson is a joyful worker and this lifts morale of park staff even in difficult times.  The park has experienced a high level of new law enforcement challenges coupled with the loss of 3 permanent park positions that are vital to our success to continue a high level of service to the constituentsâ€™ of North Carolina.  He has struggled to handle all the expectations we are given.  It is our duty to keep people safe and we have managed in a large part to Keith Nealsonâ€™s leadership. His support from his position is wielded with a confident grace.    In the face of this, many folks would falter, but Nealson has not.  Nealson creates a true teamwork atmosphere in the park, where all staff work together for a common goal of providing an excellent state park and safe family fun.  State parks allow anyone to enjoy our natural world, Nealson upholds our mission by example.\r\nNealson is an extraordinarily talented educational interpreter. He encourages his staff to give better than average programs.  Every staff member who is interested may learn and give programs to visitors.  We have become a great resource for seasonal staff to cut their teeth at teaching environmental curricula, which helps them prepare for a park ranger interview and continue to serve our division.  We have given a huge amount of programs compared to the few amount of hours permanent staff have to work at programming, in part to Nealsonsâ€™ leadership and willingness to be creative with how we serve our visitors with what we have to give.  We have given good programs despite meager funding for more work expected.  Nealson maintains and expects excellence and we all work to provide that for him and our visitors.  Despite the challenges of running a largely visited park with an ever decreasing budget Keith Nealson has done a stellar job that is more than the average bear.  He deserves to be recognized for his effort with the Thomas C. Ellis Award or another award of excellence equal to his merits.\r\n','jack.singley@ncparks.gov','919-383-1686','','ENRI','NODI','','2013-08-02','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','No','','','','0000-00-00','','Singley4600,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','uploads/2013/AN_017_other_file_3_6202.doc',''),(18,'AN_018','2013','Award Presentation Complete','1','Jane Mary Umstead','On August 1, 2013, Jane Mary Umstead submitted her resignation at Eno River State Park.  It wasnâ€™t an easy decision for her, as she has worked at Eno River for 19 years in various positions.  That might not seem too extraordinary until you consider that Jane started working at our park after her first retirement when she was 66 years of age.  She began by working in a part-time permanent position.   When the OA position went to full time, she regularly volunteered.  Finally when parks were given seasonal office assistant positions, Jane was the first.  She knew how to greet and direct people to their park destinations and also knew how to suggest various activities that would interest individuals, sometimes by sharing bits of park history.  You see, Jane grew up and still lives just a couple of miles from the park, so she is full of historical facts about this area.  Sheâ€™s also an outdoor gal, loves camping and hiking; she still goes with her nieces once a year on a camping trip to the Toe River in western NC.  Jane is full of character and park visitors enjoy her knowledge of the area and past story events she shares. \r\n\r\nI remember one time she came to work, looking quite proud of herself, and I asked her what she had been up to that day.  She went on to tell me that she had some annoying crows at her house that liked to sit on her roof but she had solved the problem.  Whenever the crows decided to gather for their â€œmeetingâ€ on her roof, she would just take her gun out into her yard, point it Heavenward and let â€˜er rip.  Yep, the crows werenâ€™t hurt but got the message loudly.  This was not a story that she shared with the public!\r\n\r\nJane M Umstead loves the Division of Parks and Recreation and especially Eno River State Park.  We havenâ€™t seen the last of Jane, I am sure.  She will be the first one we will call to volunteer in the office when needed and as usual, she will excitedly respond.  \r\n\r\nI would like to proudly nominate Jane Mary Umstead for the Thomas C Ellis award.\r\n\r\nKaren Wilson\r\n','karen.wilson@ncparks.gov','919-383-1686','','ENRI','NODI','','2013-08-06','','','','','','No','','No','','','','0000-00-00','','Wilson2631,Wilson2631,Wilson2631,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(19,'AN_019','2013','Award Presentation Complete','2','Bruce Rountree','Dismal Swamp State Park boardwalk project.  \r\n\r\nMaintenance Mechanics Bruce Rountree and Carlton Griffin worked tirelessly over a 2 year period to complete a Â½ mile loop boardwalk for the benefit of all park visitors.

Her love of the park runs deep.   Upon her retirement from the Methodist Retirement Home, where she served as an administrative assistant, Jane immediately volunteered to serve as an office assistant at the park.  During those days the park had only a part time morning office assistant and Jane on most days would cover the afternoon in the park office Monday â€“ Friday so someone would be there to assist park visitors and answer the telephone.  Frequently she volunteered twenty hours a week.  In 1994 the park was awarded a full time permanent office assistant, however the current office assistant did not desire full time work so a job sharing situation was arranged.  Jane continued right on with her afternoon shifts, only now getting paid for the job she loved.  This continued for more than a year when the original office assistant left and the job shares were merged into a full time position.  Jane, not wishing to work full time, stepped back out of her role as a permanent part-time staff member and went back to volunteering.  She shifted her time to the weekends as the park had never been able to open the office to the public on the very days when public information and assistance was most needed.  In 1997 the park was granted funding for a seasonal office assistant.  This was arranged into two positions working alternating weekends.  From that time until August 2013, Jane has faithfully worked two to three weekends every month in the park office.  Many times when the permanent office assistant was on leave, Jane was right back in the office during the week, volunteering her time unpaid so someone would be there for the visitors and telephone.  She did not have to be asked.  When she heard the office assistant would be gone would ask if she could come in to help.  For many years she volunteered at the Eno River Festival state park booth or volunteered to cover the office unpaid so the permanent office assistant could work at the festival.  There is no record of how many visitors that came into the office, or persons on the telephone were helped by Jane as she with great care gave directions, promoted programs, told people about the wonderful things to see in the park, told people the rules, registered campers, and radioed rangers of reported emergencies.  But in 20 years, those people helped have to number in the tens of thousands.  She was a constant help to the staff with administrative duties, always enthusiastic about helping the staff for whom she cared for immensely.  Now after 20 years, at an age Jane does not wish to talk about (but approaching the nine decades mark)she has decided it is time to step away from park work and announced her resignation.  This was a difficult decision as her love of the park has not waned.','dave.cook@ncparks.gov','(919) 841-4059','','NODI','NODI','','2013-08-23','','','','','','No','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Cook4712,Cook4712,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(23,'AN_023','2013','Award Presentation Complete','2','Garry Hoover, Gary Pippen','Garry Hoover and Gary Pippen, maintenance mechanics at Hanging Rock, have constructed a new vault toilet building at group camp. While this may not sound glamorous or heroic, it exemplifies every aspect of what this award was intended to recognize. \r\n1. They went beyond expectations by doing this project themselves, instead of contracting it out. They used their own skills and experience in construction, carpentry, plumbing, roofing, lighting,  heavy equipment operation, landscaping, etc. \r\n2. This also is beyond expectations because they did all this work during the summer season, when the park was very busy with routine work and emergency repairs. We normally have 4 maintenance mechanics, but two of them retired this summer, leaving Gary and Garry to do all the work. Despite being short staffed and working on this vault toilet, the park still maintained it\'s high level of cleanliness and order. \r\n3. By doing the work themselves, instead of contracting it out, this special effort saved the state approximately $13,000.00 .  Lance White estimates that if it had been contacted, it would have cost well over $30,000.00\r\n4. This vault toilet also provides and ADA accessible restroom to group camp, which was not available before. This is a highly desirable benefit, as it further allows an additional type of user to experience the park. \r\n5. Creative efforts were used in two ways. They used wood and natural colors on the siding, and finished the concrete floor to have the color and texture of natural stone, in keeping with the guidelines, keeping the building look and feel appropriate for the park atmosphere. Also, since there is no electricity at group camp, they are installing high efficiency LED lighting, run by solar recharged batteries. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n','robin.Riddlebarger@ncparks.gov','336-593-8480','','HARO','NODI','','2013-08-28','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Riddlebarger1629,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','uploads/2013/AN_023_other_file_1_4624.jpg','',''),(24,'AN_024','2013','DENIED pending review - comments below','5','Chandler Reich, Grace Pryor','Chandler Reich and Grace Pryor are seasonals at Hanging Rock, employed as Lifeguards at Hanging Rock Lake. \r\nOn Tuesday, July 23, 2013, Pryor and Reich were on duty at the lake.

However as discussions began with Exhibit Technician Martin Kane and I&E Program Manager Sean Higgins the idea significantly expanded into a Visitor Center-type series of exhibits.  Everyone on the work group was supportive of the expanded idea, however, there was no opportunity to pursue additional funding to pay for professional exhibit contractors.  Realizing what an amazing opportunity the park had to offer a quality I&E experience like no other in the NC State Park system, the park staff offered to devote a considerable amount of time and effort into trying to build the exhibits themselves.  All of the text was written by park staff.  All of the exhibits were constructed and installed entirely by park staff and completed with a budget of $12,000.\r\n\r\nThrough 18 station of activities, signs and structures an experience was created that is whimsical, relaxing, challenging, thought provoking and inspiring.

Contact: Jane Conolly, 910.436-4681.','As the park superintendent of Carvers Creek State Park, I, Jane Conolly am proud to nominate my staff for the Special Achievement Award for 2013.  This would include the seasonal staff.  \r\n\r\n	In July 2012 I started my tenure as the park superintendent at Carvers Creek State Park.  At that time I taught the staff, all new to state parks, what the divisionâ€™s Mission Statement is and what it means.  I taught them that state parks are a critical part of our society providing safe outdoor recreation not only to the benefits of physical fitness, but also to the enrichment of the human mind and spirit.  I told the staff we teach people stewardship and understanding of our natural resources.  Also, that we protect and manage these recreational and natural resources as we are in the forever business.   We discussed the role of safety not only in relation to their daily assignments, but also how important public safety was in the park.\r\n\r\n	Then I challenged them to join me in the goal of completing the interim development project and getting Carvers Creek State Park open to the public as soon as our time and resources would allow.  I am so proud to say my staff rose to that challenge and took it forward in a determined and dedicated manner.  All members of the staff had their role to play and they all worked very hard from the first week of July 2012 to September 9, 2013 when the park opened its gates to the public.\r\n\r\n	Park Ranger Colleen Bowers worked tirelessly developing wayside panels, two informational panels, a park brochure, researching the cultural and natural history of the park, developed an Interpretation and Education program, worked on many maintenance projects, provided leadership while the park was without a superintendent, for many months was the parkâ€™s safety officer, developed a detailed knowledge of the parkâ€™s land, and all while working towards her Environment Education Certification and the complex and varied duties as a ranger.  She also worked to support operations and I&E at Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve and Raven Rock State Park.\r\n\r\n	Maintenance Mechanic LeRoy Boles worked closely with Pete Mitchell, SODI MM V, and me to take up the task of building the physical elements of the park such as picnic areas, renovation of buildings, fences, installing signs, road repair, culverts, installation of a water line, and many, many more.  LeRoy did all these things fulfilling routine maintenance for a park with over 60 structures including two residences and a large shop complex.  LeRoy worked closely with me to oversee the complex interim development project by working closely with all contractors.  He and I kept contractors on task ensuring quality work and reducing costs.  He has been the parkâ€™s safety officer since January 2013 and has taken the parkâ€™s safety program to very high standards.   He has provided excellent leadership to the seasonal staff by teaching them many skills and demonstrating a strong work ethic.  \r\n\r\n	My seasonal staff to include: Julian Miller, Daniel Moniz, and Alex Yott have not only worked very hard at routine seasonal tasks, but have in fact completed a lot of work at a Maintenance Mechanic I or II level.  They have done this work at seasonal pay, with no benefits, and all of them have worked for the division for more than a year and a half.   LeRoy, the seasonal staff, and I agreed that they would complete their assigned tasks with the added benefit of learning new skills under the capable tutelage of LeRoy.  This seasonal staff has so many times put their dedication of purpose, muscle, and skills to the tasks at hand that it makes me very proud.  They have worked in all kinds of weather and met many goals.  Carvers Creek State Park could simply not have been opened without their work and dedication.  \r\n\r\n        At this risk of sounding conceded I will simply say that my own contribution to the goal of getting Carvers Creek State Park open has been to try to lead by example, provide leadership in a manner that kept projects moving forward, provided staff with needed resources, and development of a teamwork approach.  I would have to leave it to others to decide if I have succeeded.  \r\n\r\n	As July 2012 flew into July 2013 the staff and I kept thinking we were surly nearly ready to open the park.  So much had been completed.  However, as the interim development project neared completion the tasks of getting the park opened seemed to take on a life of their own growing more and more every day.  For example, with the park office building physically in place the amount of work to furnish it, organize, set-up communications, work stations, services and resources for the public was a huge undertaking of its own.  Office Assistant Steven Childers started working at this position during the first week of February 2013 and during that time he has been critical to moving the park to the last seven months until opening day in September.  Steve has dedicated himself to learning all the OA tasks and he did so in a short amount of time and to very good effect.  He was instrumental in getting the park office itself open and operational.  He freed me from many of the OA duties that I had been doing for seven months which allowed me to spend more time on moving the interim development project and other park goals forward.  As a member of the Wounded Warrior Program at Fort Bragg Steve completed many hours of volunteer work at the park before his employment.  \r\n\r\n	With all the work the staff has completed to get Carvers Creek State Park opened they did so while also supporting other parks on many projects or staffing needs especially at WEWO and RARO.  Colleen has assisted with the PIMO fire and the MOMO storm clean-up.   LeRoy assisted with the MOMO clean-up as well.   I have been the acting superintendent for WEWO since July 1, 2013.\r\n\r\n	Park staff has also maintained a burn program, volunteer program, worked on invasive plants removal projects, attended all regular training requirements, presented monthly safety meetings, kept-up with mowing and other routine park maintenance tasks.  Senior park staff has worked closely with many division sections such as the trails, natural resources, land protection, engineering and construction, and others on many projects and needs.\r\n\r\n	Now that the park is open the staff has worked hard and successfully to meet the needs of park visitors.   We have established opening, closing, and cleaning routines.  We are providing access to the parkâ€™s Mill pond to the disabled and elderly.  I&E programs are being presented.  We are getting much positive feedback from the park visitors in relation to what we are providing to them.  This is a direct reflection on all our hard work.  An example project was the emergency creation of an overflow parking lot as the 19 spaces provided by the interim development was wholly insufficient.  On nice weather weekends we are maintaining parking for 60 to 70 vehicles at all times.        \r\n\r\n	So how can I share with you, the Awards Committee just how much the Carvers Creek staff have accomplished in the last year and three months?  It is a daunting task in itself so I have listed below some of our, â€œTo Do,â€ lists.  These by no means list every task, job, and project we have completed, but it gives you a good idea of what the staff has accomplished.  Please take a look at these pages below my closing.  \r\n\r\n     	In closing I respectfully submit the staff of Carvers Creek State Park for the Special Achievement Award for 2013.   I submit that the staff has worked shoulder to shoulder on many difficult projects well above and beyond what is routinely expected of a park staff for day to day operations including the seasonal staff.   Only a handful of division staff knows what it takes to open a park, but I can honestly say it is a huge undertaking which this staff has met to a very high standard.   Please look at the two lists an idea of the work projects completed by park staff.   These lists although not complete give a good example of the work completed.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nJane Conolly, Park Superintendent\r\nCarvers Creek State Park\r\n910.436.4681\r\nJane.conolly@ncparks.gov\r\n\r\nCACR Project Lists July 2012 to 2013\r\n\r\nNote: RH = Rockefeller House\r\n\r\nInterim Development: Highest Priority\r\nïƒ˜	Name things!

I was on patrol of the four wheel drive beach at the time.  I radioed Maintenance Mechanic Jessica Sutton to respond with rescue equipment and find the exact location.  I arrived on scene approximately 5 minutes later.\r\n I could see 6 individuals in a group struggling and continuing to drift out.  I took off my defensive equipment and gave it to a Kure Beach Officer that arrived on scene.  I then took 2 rescue cans and entered the water.  To the side of me was a gentleman assisting a group of 3 other swimmers and seemed to be doing good getting them in.  I swam out to the group of six, with one other gentleman who I gave a rescue can to.  They were pretty tired when I got to them.  I first made sure everyone was alright and made sure that all parties were accounted for which they were.  At that point I encouraged them to start kicking and trying to swim to the side.  By this point I knew we were in a pretty bad rip current.  We were making slow progress, when 2 more responders form Kure Beach entered the water.  Although still a struggle we all made it back to shore.  I estimate that I was in the water at least 20 minutes and initially got to the group about 100 yards off shore.  All parties were evaluated by EMS and all left on their own power.\r\nInitially all of these adults had responded to the water to rescue 5 children who got caught in the rip current. I was informed the ages of the children were 12, 12, 11, 10, and 9. \r\nThe Kure Beach responders that assisted were Bass and Heglar (last names only).  The names of the group of 6 that we rescued were; Ron and Austin Jenkins, Hector Santiago, Joshua Dankosky, Jonathan Craig, and Dori Painter.\r\n\r\nThe scene was cleared at 1610.\r\n','jay.greenwood@ncparks.gov','1-919-841-4058','','SODI','SODI','','2014-04-30','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 Awarded in 2014.dw','Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Caudle3874,Tillotson5212,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894','','','','',''),(31,'AN_031','2014','Award Granted','3','Kirk Keller, 919-739-6815','Fort Macon State Park would like to nominate the Applied Technologies Division of Wayne Community College for the Locke Craig Award.  In 2009, a partnership was established between this division of Wayne Community College and the N. C. Division of State Parks to construct functional, full-scale replicas of 19th century cannon carriages as permanent outdoor exhibits for the interpretation of Fort Macon State Park.  Previously, two wooden replica cannon carriages used by the park for several years on top of the fort had become decayed in the coastal environment to the point they were a physical hazard to park visitors.  The park was seeking to replace these with maintenance-free replica cannon carriages made of aluminum, which have been used by the National Park Service with great success.  However, the going price for aluminum carriages from commercial sources was $40,000 to $50,000 apiece.\r\nFortunately, Wayne Community College came to the rescue to assist the Division of State Parks.  Their industrial program was large enough to take on such a project to build the aluminum cannon carriage itself, and at a great monetary savings for the state. This proved to be the largest project of its kind ever undertaken at the college that involved all its industrial classes: Mechanical Engineering Technologies classes to convert old 1860s military drawings of cannon carriages to modern blueprint and Computer Assisted Drawing (CAD) format, and Computer Integrated Machining and Welding Technologies classes to do the actual work of building the cannon carriage.  The project would be beneficial both to the college and to State Parks by garnering much work experience, public attention and interest in the collegeâ€™s industrial programs, as well as help State Parks by replacing rotten, hazardous wood cannon carriages with maintenance-free carriages at considerable savings to the state.  The college would build the new cannon carriage for only the cost of materials, while its students would gain vast practical experience in the fabrication of the carriage.  \r\nWork started on the project in the fall of 2009 and was completed in 2010.  The students of the various technologies programs received invaluable training as they collaborated on the project.  They were involved in all phases from the drawing board to fabrication, assembly and completion. The total cost of the cannon carriage was $22,000 (including some parts that had to be subcontracted), a savings to the State of North Carolina of $28,000.\r\nDuring 2011 Wayne Community College completed two additional cannon carriages under the same arrangement in time to observe the Sesquicentennial of the battle of Fort Macon in 1862.  Replica 32-pounder cannons were mounted on all three of the cannon carriages, which made possible their use in reenacted â€œbombardmentsâ€ during the Sesquicentennial observances.  In addition, the cost saving to the State for the three cannon carriages totaled in excess of $80,000 as opposed to purchasing three carriages from commercial vendors.  The cannons have since been used in public demonstrations and reenactments as part of the parkâ€™s historical interpretive program.\r\nIn July, 2014, Wayne Community College agreed to construct two more aluminum replica cannon carriages under the same agreement to enable Fort Macon State Park to restore another part of the fortâ€™s armament in time for the centennial anniversary observance of the founding of North Carolina State Parks in 2016.\r\nThe partnership between the Applied Technologies Division of Wayne Community College and N. C. State Parks has resulted in the creation of three outdoor interpretive exhibits at Fort Macon State Park that most likely would not otherwise exist.  It has benefitted N. C. State Parks and the citizens of North Carolina in helping further the historic interpretation of one of the most important historic sites in North Carolina, as well as resulted in a savings to the State of over $80,000.  For these reasons, the public spirit, helpfulness and hard work of the Applied Technologies Division of Wayne Community College is most deserving of recognition by bestowing upon it the Locke Craig Award.\r\n\r\n','paul.branch@ncparks.gov','252-726-3775','','FOMA','EADI','','2014-08-15','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','No','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 This award is on CHOP desk awaiting awarding it to Mr. Keller or Wayne Community College.

Mr. Greiner is an officer in the 1st North Carolina/11th Regiment reenacting unit and has been associated with Fort Macon State Park for over fourteen years in living history demonstrations at the park both with his unit and as an individual volunteer.  His interest in the history of Fort Macon has prompted him to become one of the leading volunteers at the park and he is currently the volunteer historic weapons coordinator for the parkâ€™s interpretive program.  Since 2001, Mr. Greiner has been a regular volunteer on the Fort Macon cannon crew, serving in all crew positions and commanding the crew as Gunner.  He serves as an instructor to train reenactors and other volunteers to participate in historic artillery demonstrations at the park.  At his own expense, he has completed historic weapons safety certification courses given by the Division of State Historic Sites, Department of Cultural Resources, for both historic small arms and artillery in order to act as a Certified Safety Officer to help the park staff oversee historic weapons programs at the park.  He also volunteers individually as a living history reenactor in various park interpretive programs each year.  By virtue of his extensive workshop at his home, he has been able to make repairs to various items of park equipment free of charge.

Umstead State Park for over 20 years.  Dr. Jean Spooner is a PHD with NC State University in the Soil and Water Conservation Department.  She has served as chair of the Umstead Coalition since 1993 and is a long time member of the park advisory committee.  Through the Umstead Coalition, Dr. Spooner has raised tremendous support and donations for the park and has helped to protect the park from a major road being constructed through the park and represented the park in numerous political decisions concerning the park both with the City of Raleigh and the State of North Carolina.  Dr. Spooner has assisted the park with submitting grants that have led to over $60,000 for park protection and preservation and has also helped the park in acquiring several critical parcels of land adjacent to the park.  Jean Spooner\'s contributions have been many and it is impossible to begin to document the number of hours spent and ways her efforts have assisted the park.  Dr. Spooner is very humble about her efforts so much of this work goes unrecorded.  The following though are some examples of her service to the park:\r\n\r\n-In 1993, NCDOT had plans to construct a road through the middle of Umstead State Park.  The route this road would have created would have negatively impacted the natural resources of the park and the road would have been heavily traveled by Raleigh commuter traffic.  Jean was able to organize the community to speak out against the project.  She intervened on many levels working with local and state politicians to stop the project.  Her efforts resulted in several additional protections for the park including having a large section of park property come under the dedicated nature preserve act, the National Resister of Historic Places, protection in Raleigh zoning codes, and numerous other land protections that continue to benefit the park.\r\n\r\n-To have more time for her volunteer efforts, Dr. Spooner negotiated a reduction in her work hours and salary with NC State University.  Despite the reduction in hours and salary, she continued to complete all the duties and responsibilities of a department Chair and also dedicate a tremendous amount of personal time to the park both in fund raising/advocacy work and also many meetings with State and local officials. \r\n\r\n-Dr. Spooner is very experience with local and state government procedure.  She is able to speak on the parks behalf and advocate for the park.  She also has the ability to do this in the proper and positive way to build relationships and promote the park. She is able to represent the park in a productive manner.\r\n\r\n-Dr. Spooner has assisted with acquiring several sections of land to add to the park including 84 acres from the adjacent Angus Barn.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to place a value on the ways Jean Spooner has benefited William B. Umstead State Park.  Without her help and advocacy, the park would be a much different place.  She has contributed her time and efforts greatly and gladly and needs to be officially recognized for her contributions.','scott.letchworth@ncparks.gov','919-571-4170','','WIUM','NODI','','2014-09-22','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 Awarded in 2014.dw','Letchworth5004,Letchworth5004,Letchworth5004,Letchworth5004,Letchworth5004,Gallagher9613,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Oneal1133,Williams5894','','','','',''),(40,'AN_040','2014','Award Presentation Complete','3','Joe Lugiano','Joe Lugiano has been a long time volunteer at the park and currently serves as the citizen park volunteer coordinator.

Their development of the BIT (basic interpretive training) program has added a level of consistency in our training of new interpreters.  Their development and ongoing modification of the AIT (advanced interpretive training) systems has allowed for park staff to instruct on and learn about many new topics that are culturally and ecologically relevant to our public presentations.  I was particularly grateful when the Council modified the AIT system to make it blend with the requirements for maintaining active ee certification. The establishment of rewards for completing AIT cycles was a great improvement (and incentive) to the system. \r\n The councilâ€™s latest effort at establishing a new â€˜I&E Mindmeldâ€™ website to allow for better sharing of division resources and ideas is brilliant and much needed.\r\nThe majority of the I&E council members are not required to be on the council.  They do it of their own free will with the intention of bettering their division, their department, and their state.\r\n \r\nThis is challenging time in state parks for environmental education as a whole.  When I was first hired with the parks system 16 years ago it was hammered into me that Interpretation and Education was the park rangerâ€™s number one priority.  Since that time staff and funding has shrunk while hours of operation and administrative and public safety duties have expanded.  This has in some ways made I&E less of a priority as we struggle to make operational ends meet.  In these challenging times the efforts towards the critical job of educating the public about the importance of their natural world needs champions.  I think the council in many ways serves as one of those champions.  Please consider awarding the council this special achievement award.\r\nThe current council consists of the following members- Sharon Becker, Kevin Bischof, Brian Bockhahn, Jeff Davidson, Renee Evans, Sean Higgins, Brittany Hurtado, Bill Meyer, Adrian Oâ€™Neal, Timothy Rayworth, Kathryn Royall, Jack Singley, Mary Smith, and Jessie Summers.  I think each one of those members truly deserves a special thank you, so I am nominating the council as a whole.  Should the award committee decide to recognize it with an award the three primary people that should be contacted are Adrian Oâ€™Neal (East District Superintendent), Sean Higgins (Divison I&E coordinator) and Jack Singley (chair of the council).\r\n','keith.nealson@ncparks.gov','9193831686','','ENRI','NODI','','2014-09-25','','','No','Yes','No','No','No','No','','','','0000-00-00','','Nealson7511,Tillotson5212,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Bash8938,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(45,'AN_045','2014','Award Presentation Complete','2','Pam Pearson','I would like to nominate Pam Pearson for a much deserved Special Achievement Award in November 2014.

When you do, it makes you realize how fortunate you are to have such a person working for the division in your park.  There are employees all across our division who are working extremely hard every day to help our park system grow and who are providing excellent customer service.  One such person who has been working at Hammocks Beach for the past six and half years is Office Assistant Pam Pearson.  Pam has been an asset not only to park visitors but to park staff as well.  Pam conducts her regular duties as an Office Assistant at the park in a very proficient manner. She is always available to help seasonal and permanent staff with administrative tasks, payroll problems and park operations.\r\n\r\nPam is quick to volunteer to be on a planning committee for park related events such as Military Appreciation Day, Paddle Festival, Seasonal Orientation and other Hammocks Beach Friends Group activities as well as Friends of State Park Conferences.  In addition to park event planning, Pam has volunteered to be on the Centralized Reservation Committee and has participated in weekly and bi-monthly telephone conferences to implement and improve the system.  She has tested new CRS programs and has implemented operational procedures at HABE through the CRS that have streamlined point-of-sale procedures for ferry ticket sales, seasonal uniform sales, and special activity permits.  \r\n\r\nDuring the past year, when no one volunteered to be the secretary for the parkâ€™s friends group, she took on that task and recorded the minutes of quarterly meetings and updated the FHBI website.  She is also working this year with friend group members in organizing the parkâ€™s popular marsh cruises which will be led for the first time by park volunteers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to keeping her husband, David Pearson, President of FHBI and President of Friends of State Parks on task and out of trouble (which is a full-time job in itself), she often keeps me abreast of daily park operational situations and needs.  The past couple of years Pam volunteered to be on the APC Council and this year was the chairperson for this DPR training session.  As you can see in the nomination below by Chief of Operations Office Assistant, Denise Williams; Pam has put forth an enormous amount time developing presentations for this training session that would be beneficial to all Office Assistants across the division.  Please consider Pam Pearson for the Special Achievement Award nomination.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPaul Donnelly, Park Superintendent\r\nHammocks Beach State Park\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNomination from Denise Williams; Chief of Operations Office Assistant:\r\n\r\nI would like to nominate Pam Pearson for a much deserved Special Achievement Award in November 2014.  Pam has many assigned park tasks to complete at the same time providing excellent customer service to numerous park visitors that have confided in the OPS office.  Over and above being an excellent Office Assistant III, she has volunteered with the CRS implementation and testing from the beginning of the reservation conversations and implementation and continues to test and notify the company of any issues that arise on behalf of DPR parks.  Pam joined the APC (Administrative Professional Council) and immediately set about meeting our training/coaching goals for the council and has broken down many workflows to assist DPR new and old office assistants and staff that fill in for vacancies.  Her easy approach is evident if you review the FIND database for the following:  FIND  #378 Seasonal Hiring Forms Presentation and produced a seasonal employee checklist for complete workflows to match the DPR HR hiring procedures.  FIND#377 BEACON How to for Seasonal Employee Hire/Separation Tracking.  FIND #361-322 Microsoft Outlook and Calendar Training when it was implemented.  Find #482 APC Office Assistant and Superintendent HR Training 2014 planned by the APC as Chair with a focus on customer service and a liaison with DENR HR Instructors along with DPR HR instructors for better understanding and explanation for us to use the workflows.  Find #375 Time administrative SAPGUI BEACON seasonal time instruction.  Pam has been influential in the path and event setup for the APC and has taken the much needed hands-on training approach and offered to all office assistants or Superintendents and even seasonal office assistants during vacancies.  Pam is proactive in locating various training resources, testing them and bringing them to office assistants statewide for the opportunity to learn at your desk and will always coach you if you need help or advice on how processes work for HABE and other parks using the same training resources.  Please consider her for this award.  Her Superintendent will add to this nomination with information about her contributions over and above what is demanded at HABE.  Please allow him opportunity to add to my nomination facts.  I have left out some that we all take for granted.  She is always open to testing databases for Tom Howard and I when we are working through a request database procedure workflow.  She makes me feel proud to be part of this division.

I am hoping to be able to present the award to to Blake\'s wife at the same time I present the Locke Craig award to Joe Lugiano.\r\n\r\nJoe and Blake were best friends and worked side by side on many volunteer projects in the park.  Most notably, Blake put in significant hours along side Joe on a restoration project in the park.  Over 100 historic buildings (cabins and dining halls) were restored at the park completely by volunteers funded by grants.  Joe and Blake coordinated all of the volunteer labor for the project and each put in significant hours of their time working on the cabins.  Without Joe and Blake organizing and driving the project, I do not believe the project would have been completed.  Working together, Joe and Blake managed 5,182 volunteer hours on the REI project alone.  During this project, we have in our records Blake Norwood completing at least 640 hours of volunteer work himself and I suspect the actual number of hours is even higher but everything may not have been recorded.\r\n\r\nJoe and Blake have also worked together on trail work in the park, have donated equipment to the park including a new freezer for a dining hall and a gas powered pole trimmer the maintenance staff needed.\r\n\r\nBlake leaves behind a very nice wife who has always supported him and she has been a part of the park family right along with Blake.  I know that she is going to miss him greatly and have a hard time adjusting to life without her husband.  I\'m hoping that an opportunity to award Blake along with Joe will give her a nice memory and create an opportunity for us to have her out to the park to recognize her husband\'s impact he had on everyone.\r\n\r\nThis award would mean a lot to Blake\'s wife and to Joe Lugiano. \r\n\r\n','scott.letchworth@ncparks.gov','919-571-4170','','WIUM','NODI','','2014-10-31','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 Awarded in 2014.dw','Letchworth5004,Letchworth5004,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Peek1873,Bash8938,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Williams5894','','','','',''),(53,'AN_053','2015','Award Granted','2','Ryan Newsome','Last year in the spring of 2014 Park Ranger Ryan Newsome was tasked with the project of applying for an Americorps crew to help us get a handle on our exotic invasive species problem here at Medoc Mountain State Park. \\r\\nRyan developed a plan of action, put together an exotic invasive species removal plan, and coordinated this plan with the divisionâ€™s Natural Resource section. Ryan then began the lengthy process of applying with Americorps for a team. He began a search to find them a place to stay and found a place at the 4-H camp in the town of Halifax. Ryan was advised that his application had been accepted and that the park would be getting a team of eight in the month of March 2015. He met with the county 4-H Director, Joe Long and worked out a plan for the team to stay there and also volunteer some of their time to work on improvements to that facility. \\r\\nRyan met in person with the Americorps representative and gave them a tour of our facilities, the 4-H facility, and showed them what the team would be doing. When the eight member team arrived he did all the necessary orientation with them, making sure they had an understanding of where they were and what was expected of them both here at the park and at the 4-H center. They all received gift packets from Halifax County Convention and Visitors Bureau with things to do and see. Ryan also arranged a canoeing outing, and complimentary tickets to visit Sylvan Heights Waterfowl Park in Scotland Neck, NC to help fill their spare time.\\r\\nIn order to properly execute the Exotic Invasive Species removal plan Ryan attended the North Carolina Pesticide Applicators Licensing course and passed the exam, determined how much and what type of pesticide to purchase, ensured that we had all of the necessary tools and equipment, gave the team a safety briefing on the use of the hand tools, chemical applications, and the proper use of the parkâ€™s chipper. Ryan continuously worked with the team operating the chain saw, and supervising the progress and quality of the work. \\r\\nOne of the requirements Ryan put on the team was to put together and give a 30 minute program to the public at the park on what they did at the end of their assignment, which they did an excellent job!\\r\\nOn the last day of their assignment, Ryan and his family supplied and cooked a thank you and farewell dinner for them that was served at the picnic shelter.\\r\\nDue to the time and effort that Ryan put into this project, approximately 900 hours of invasive species removal (mostly Chinese Privet, Japanese Honeysuckle, and Wisteria) was accomplished here at Medoc Mountain State Park, other areas were identified for future work, not one injury was reported, partnerships were strengthened between the park and the Halifax County 4-H, Halifax County Convention and Visitors Bureau, and Sylvan Heights Waterfowl Park. Ryan also conducted two prescribed burns during the month of March, fulfilling his requirements for his North Carolina Burn Boss Certification.\\r\\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I believe that Park Ranger Ryan Newsome should be awarded the divisionâ€™s Special Achievement Award. \\r\\n','bill.d.meyer@ncparks.gov','252-586-6588','','MEMO','NODI','','2015-03-30','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Meyer1154,Greenwood3841,Bash8938,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Greenwood3841','','','uploads/2015/AN_053_other_file_1_1763.JPG','',''),(54,'AN_054','2015','Award Presentation Complete','5','Nicole Crider and Joseph Hawley','On Saturday, March 21, GOCR Ranger Nicole Crider and GOCR Environmental Specialist Joseph Hawley saved a man\\\'s life.

For years Fort Fisher had had a major problem with non-native red foxes.  These foxes were destroying almost all bird nests and interfering with sea turtle nesting and predating a  majority of the nests.  A Fox Management Plan was created by Park Staff and the Operations Section in June 2008.  Everyone recognized the need to remove these predators.  The problem was implementing the plan.  We were to shoot on site when it was safe, and away from the public.  This is a very challenging thing to do and only resulted in a handful of foxes removed in the first several years.  Heavy predation continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo give you an idea of how bad it was is in 2012 19 out of 30 Sea Turtle nests were predated by fox, resulting in only a 57% successful hatch rate for the season.  The American Oystercatchers (Bird) had 15 nesting attempts in the season all were predated.  This was the standard.  No one on staff had seen an oystercatcher chick in over 10 years.  Basically you could go back from 2012 and hit the repeat button and you would have the same results as 2012. Something different had to be done.  So we began to look into trapping.  We looked at first to contract with APHIS, a private company that does removal projects.  We were not excited about how they wanted to hide it from the public and simply the cost, as it was going to be several thousand dollars.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I spoke with Ranger Kip Futch at Carolina Beach he said he would like to try.  For weeks we scouted the area looking for signs and dens.  In December of 2012 Ranger Futch placed traps in the dunes at Fort Fisher.  For a 10 day period he would come in at 6AM to check the traps, and place new ones or move existing ones, all of which is time consuming. During that 10 day stretch Ranger Futch removed 15 red foxes and 2 coyotes from the park! In May of 2013 he removed 5 foxes and in December of 2013 3 foxes were removed. In May of 2014 3 coyotes were removed, and in December 2014 4 foxes and 2 coyotes were removed.  In all Ranger Kip has trapped and euthanized 27 red foxes and 7 coyotes since he started.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what has been the benefit? In the summer of 2013 after the first major round of trapping Fort Fisher had 52 sea turtle nests laid.  First it was the most we had ever had.  Secondly only 1 nest was predated!  The hatch success rate was over 86%! The first oystercatcher chicks in 10 years were seen!  In 2014 we had 18 sea turtle nests with no predation.  Hatch success rate was at 87%!   At least 40 least tern (bird) nests were spotted.  No one on staff had seen those before. So far in 2015 we have 55 sea turtle nests with no predation! (another record).  Staff have found and numbered over 170 least tern nests!  We have had to rope off areas of the beach due to so many which is great!  Finally we have banded 3 oystercatcher chicks and we\\\'re banding more next week!\\r\\n\\r\\nRanger Futch did most all of this work on his own.  All the equipment he uses is his own personal equipment, and it has been no additional cost to the state.  The numbers above don\\\'t lie.  Kip has gone above and beyond to turn the resource management program at Fort Fisher around.  He has graciously offered to continue these efforts for years to come.  Without him I am 100% certain we not have oystercatcher chicks, least tern nests and chicks, and great hatch rates for sea turtles without his efforts!  This is why Ranger Kip Futch deserves and has earned a Special Achievement Award. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n','jeffrey.owen@ncparks.gov','910 458-5798','','FOFI','SODI','','2015-07-06','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Owen0623,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(57,'AN_057','2015','Award Presentation Complete','2','Susan Campbell','Susan has worked part time with Weymouth for 15 years.

We ran out onto the pier and observed White Lake Fire Dept. staff performing CPR on the child victim, later identified as 4 year old.  I ran the short distance back to the vehicle to get the AED because I did not see one on hand at that time.  Stevie Tatum and another member of the White Lake FD began to start the AED and the ambulance was arriving simultaneously to the arcade area.  White Lake FD staff lifted the child up off the pier on the backboard and yelled that they were taking him to the ambulance.  The AED had not been used at this time.  Staff secured the AED and we followed to the ambulance with the victim.  EMS resumed control of the patient and assessments.  \\r\\n	Stevie Tatum continued to assist EMS in the back of the ambulance with CPR while I spoke with surrounding first responders to attempt to locate the guardian of the small child.

Dispatchers further advised that the subject was believed to be heading toward Morrow Mountain with the intention of		\\r\\ncommitting suicide. At 13:37 I received that call and spoke with the Cabarrus County Sheriff\\\'s Office.	\\r\\nToday the subject  had told his wife that he was going someplace \\\"about an hour away\\\" to kill himself.	The wife surmised that he would\\r\\nbe heading to MOMO as this is where they had married.	 I radioed all MOMO personnel giving a description of  the subjects vehicle, advising of his possible	suicidal intent.\\r\\nThe sheriffâ€™s office advised that he was pinging the subjects cellular phone and that he had traveled southward on\\r\\nHighway 52 and then turned left onto Highway 740, bolstering the theory that  The subject was driving to\\r\\nMOMO.	I asked if the subject  was armed and was told that he was almost assuredly armed, that he\\r\\nwas a gun enthusiast with many firearms; and that he held a NC concealed weapons permit.	I radioed\\r\\nthat information to Rangers Anundson and Jason Murvine, the other two commissioned officers		\\r\\nassigned to MOMO on this day.	It was a warm, sunny spring day and I knew that all parking lots in\\r\\nthe park would be at or near capacity with hikers, picnickers, and sight seers.	From experience, I\\r\\nknew that most persons that threaten or commit suicide at MOMO do it at the summit picnic area.	I\\r\\nthen radioed Anundson and Murvine	that I was proceeding to the front gate of the park in an		\\r\\nattempt to stop The subject before he could get to the crowded areas of the park.	I asked Murvine to\\r\\ngo to the summit picnic area to ascertain if the subject  had already arrived in that location.	To		\\r\\nexpedite my drive from the Kron House area to the front gate, I activated my warning lights and		\\r\\nflashers as I traveled along the main park road.	I noted that there was a steady stream of traffic\\r\\nalong the park roadways.	I had just passed the Y intersection when I passed a gray Jeep Cherokee\\r\\nmatching the description of the subjects  automobile traveling toward the interior of the park.	\\r\\nI did a three point road turn and 	headed toward the summit of Morrow Mountain.	Several hundred yards past the Y intersection I came upon Jason Murvine who was operating a marked, full-sized pickup truck with the emergency warning lights\\r\\nactivated.	Murvine was following the gray Jeep Cherokee. 	I then activated my siren and using my VHF radio advised		\\r\\nMurvine that I was right behind him.	I radioed Stanly County		\\r\\ndispatchers and advised that we were following on the main park road to the summit and that\\r\\nthe driver was not yielding to blue lights and sirens.	The dispatcher advised me that the subject  had\\r\\nindicated that \\\"he would not be taken alive\\\".	I transmitted this		\\r\\ninformation to staff.	The subject  was operating his vehicle at speeds slightly above		\\r\\nthe posted 25 MPH limit, but not at excessive speed.	When\\r\\nit became readily apparent that the subject  was not going to stop, Murvine pulled his vehicle into the\\r\\nleft lane and passed The subject.	Once past The subject, Murvine positioned his vehicle straddling the		\\r\\nyellow line and began to slow down, responding left and right as The subject attempted to drive around\\r\\nhim.	We had slowed to approximately 10 MPH when  The subject drove his vehicle hard to the left and		\\r\\naccelerated rapidly.	 The subject drove onto the scant left shoulder of the roadway and was successful\\r\\nin passing Murvine.	Murvine and I continued to pursue the subject   toward the summit picnic area with  Speed reaching approximately 35 MPH.	Upon entering the summit area parking lot, I noted that\\r\\nalmost every parking space was full of automobiles and motorcycles and there were numerous people\\r\\nin the area of the parking lot and picnic area.	The subject traveled through the parking lot, toward\\r\\nthe traffic circle at the end of the parking lot.	I radioed to Murvine \\\"Let\\\'s		\\r\\nblock him in the circle.\\\"	When we arrived at the circle,  The subject turned to the right in a counter\\r\\nclockwise direction. Murvine turned left, entering the circle in a clockwise direction and blocking\\r\\n The subject\\\'s forward progress.	I turned to the right and stopped approximately 20 feet from the rear\\r\\nof The subject\\\'s vehicle.	Upon stopping, Murvine exited his vehicle, drew his service weapon and moved\\r\\nquickly toward the driver\\\'s side door of The subject\\\'s vehicle.	Murvine was demanding: \\\"Let me see		\\r\\nyour hands.	\\\"	I place my vehicle in park, exited my vehicle, drew my service weapon and yelled:		\\r\\n\\\"Let me see your hands\\\" at least twice.	I could not see  The subject due to window tinting and the		\\r\\nangle at which I was trying to peer through the windows of the Cherokee.	As Murvine was quickly		\\r\\napproaching the driver\\\'s side door, I moved to the front of my truck and began crossing between my\\r\\nvehicle and The subject\\\'s, keeping my weapon pointed at the driver\\\'s compartment of the car.	My		\\r\\nintention was to move to the passenger side of the vehicle where I could hopefully see into the		\\r\\ninterior of the car and cover The subject.	As Murvine moved to the driver\\\'s side window, I heard him\\r\\nsay:	\\\"He\\\'s got a gun.\\\"	I saw the driver\\\'s side door of the Jeep Cherokee open and Murvine moving\\r\\ninto the V formed between the interior of the door and the main body of the vehicle.	I then heard\\r\\nI\\r\\na loud bang which I immediately recognized as a gunshot.\\r\\nThe Jeep Cherokee then began to move forward.	Murvine reached into the vehicle and \\r\\nplaced the vehicle in park, his actions stopping the forward movement of\\r\\nthe vehicle.	Murvine then backed out of the door.	Not knowing whom, if anyone had been shot.	I\\r\\nmoved quickly to the driver\\\'s side door where I discovered the body of The subject,		\\r\\nseat-belted into the driver\\\'s seat of the automobile.		I checked for a radial pulse and found none.	I went to my pickup		\\r\\ntruck and retrieved my medical response kit.	as I\\r\\nwatched I could see The subject\\\'s Adam\\\'s Apple moving up and down and surmised that he was swallowing\\r\\nI could also hear breath sounds coming from the subject\\\'s neck.		I asked EMS to assist me in removing The subject from the vehicle and placing him on		\\r\\nthe ground on his side in the recovery position, hoping that would him to breathe easier.	I reached into the vehicle and disengaged\\r\\nThe subject\\\'s seat belt and Butler and I succeeded in placing the subject on the ground and in the recovery\\r\\nposition.	This seemed to ease the subject\\\'s breathing and his skin lost the blue pallor, but he was		\\r\\nlosing blood.	I attempted to staunch some of the blood loss with weak direct		\\r\\npressure and a bandage, but could not effectively control bleeding as the wound was all around the\\r\\ntrachea. Shortly thereafter East Side Volunteer Fire Department arrived on		\\r\\nscene and took over care for the patient.		While		\\r\\nemptying The subject\\\'s pockets,	I located two speed loaders, each loaded with six rounds of what		\\r\\nappears to be .357 caliber ammunition.	In another pocket I located a speed strip loaded with six		\\r\\nrounds of what appears to be .357 caliber ammunition.	\\r\\n	\\r\\n\\r\\n			\\r\\n','jay.greenwood@ncparks.gov','9198414058','','MOMO','SODI','','2015-07-24','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(60,'AN_060','2015','DENIED pending review - comments below','4','Greg Schneider & Jason Murvine','I, Park Ranger Jason Murvine on 4/12/2015 at around 1:30pm (not sure of exact time), was advised by park superintendent Greg Schneider that a call was received from another countyâ€™s sheriffs department.  Greg advised we were to be on the look out(BOLO) for a silver jeep Cherokee with North Carolina plate CJP-5911.  A white male was supposed to be driving the jeep and he was headed to Morrow Mountain to commit suicide.  It was also mentioned that the driver would likely be armed and possessed a concealed carry permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at the visitorâ€™s center with Ranger Ron Anunson when I was advised of the BOLO.  Ron called the county to get more information on the potential suicidal male and I was in communication with Greg by radio.  Greg advised me that he was going to the front gate to try and stop the man before he entered the park and that I should go to the top of the mountain to look for the jeep.  Ron stayed at the visitorâ€™s center trying to obtain more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I left the visitorâ€™s center in my ranger truck I saw Greg in his ranger truck and he had activated his blue lights.  I activated my blue lights at that time and headed toward the top of Morrow Mountain.  When I got to the fork in the road and kept left to head to the top of the mountain, the jeep that we were looking for drove past and was heading toward the top of the mountain.  At first I didnâ€™t not recognize the vehicle as the one described in the BOLO.  I followed the vehicle approximately a quarter mile with my blue lights on.  Then Greg called me on the radio and said he was behind me.  The jeep was not pulling over to the side to let me pass, which I thought was strange.  Greg then turned his siren on and I noticed the NC plate matched the one given in the BOLO.  I then activated my siren.  The jeep continued to drive to the top of the mountain at a rate likely greater than 25mph but not excessively fast that I noticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the jeep would not pull over I decide to go around him so we could box him in.  I went around him on the left, no on coming traffic was present, and got in front of him.  Once I got in front of the jeep I slowed my vehicle considerably in an attempt to stop the jeep.  I was driving my vehicle in the middle of the road so the jeep could not pass me and Greg was still behind the jeep.  I thought we could prevent him from reaching the top and stop him from committing suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter pulling in front of the jeep, within 20-30 second the driver of the jeep went left of my ranger truck and passed me.  The jeep was part on the road and part off the road.  No on coming traffic at that point.  We are not authorized to pit vehicles or crash them in an attempt to stop them.  When the jeep passed me he increased his speed significantly.  I tried to get back around him but could not safely.  The driver kept swerving when I would attempt to pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we reached the switch back, the driver of the jeep cut the corner sharp and slung gravel from his tires.   Once we passed the switchback I could see the driver had a cell phone up to his right ear.  After the switchback turn, there was oncoming traffic present and I felt it was not longer safe to try and get around the jeep.\\r\\nOnce we arrived at the top of the mountain, the jeep drove at a normal speed past the bathroom and entered the round about at the end of the parking lot.   The jeep went to the right and went to the left in the round about.  I parked my vehicle at an angle so he could not come back out.  Greg drove his vehicle behind the jeep in the round about so he couldnâ€™t back out.  There were no other vehicles in the round about and no bystanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened the driverâ€™s door of my truck, blue lights and sirens engaged and the truck still running.  The truck was in park.  I went around my driverâ€™s door and drew my firearm and pointed it at the driver.  I was giving the driver commands, saying â€œShow me your handsâ€ and â€œGet out of the vehicleâ€.  I was approaching the jeep from the front drivers side and Greg was approaching from the rear driverâ€™s side.  I noticed Greg had his weapon drawn also.  \\r\\n\\r\\n The jeep had tinted windows and as I got closer to the vehicle I noticed the driver had a gun pointed under his chin toward the top of his head.  I yelled to Greg that the driver had a gun and it was pointed at his chin so he was aware.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI was trying to approach the driverâ€™s door and when I reached it I holstered my firearm and opened the door with my left hand.  The driverâ€™s door was unlocked. The jeep was still running, it wasnâ€™t moving so it must have been in park.  Greg had not quit gotten to jeep at this point and no bystanders were present.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I opened to the door, I started to reach to grab the gun.  As I was reaching the driver said â€œgood byâ€ and fired a single shot.  The driver had both hands on the gun, which was a dark colored revolver.  I did not fire a shot during the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the shot the driver fell back in his seat and both arms dropped down.  There was a substantial amount of blood running down his shirt and pants.  The bottom park of the drivers jaw was missing and it appeared that his esophagus or trachea was visible.  At this point I was looking for the gun and Greg was asking â€œwhere is the gun?â€.  I could not see the gun from the drivers side so I walked around and opened the passenger side front door.  I saw the gun logged between the drivers seat and the center console.  The gun appeared to have a wooden handle and was a revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point Greg was at the drivers side door and he told me not to worry about touching the gun,  the driver was no longer a threat.  I noticed pieces of bone on the passenger side dash and on the carpet near the passenger side front door.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then walked back to the driverâ€™s side of the jeep and Greg was calling EMS.  I noticed the driverâ€™s chest was still rising and falling, so he was still breathing.  The driver never made any noises.  I was not going to pull the driver out of the vehicle because I did not want to make the problem any worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then returned to my truck and turned it off, along with the siren.  Greg said that we needed to get witness information.  At some point Ranger Ron Anunson and a Badin police officer arrived at the top.  I told Ron to get information from specific people who would have seen the incident.  Ron collected information from 5 different people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Ron collected information, I began to walk through the picnic area requesting for people to leave, as we needed to close the mountain.  I noticed one individual who was taking his time leaving and was taking a video using his phone.  After clearing out the bystanders I began taping off the crime scene to keep people out.  While I was taping off the crime scene the ambulance arrived.  I left the road open until all the emergency vehicles had left the round about.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Badin police officer asked for my keys as I was clearing the mountain and he moved my truck outside of the crime scene so that the ambulance could get in.  Only one ambulance arrived, but numerous Volunteer fire members arrived on the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter clearing bystanders out of the area I returned to see the driver of the jeep had been removed from the vehicle and EMS was working on him to try and stabilize him.  Greg and the Badin police officer advised me that they had pulled him out of the jeep and put him in the recover position so that fluid could run out of his lungs and allow him to breath.  They advised that his skin color had started to turn blue as he was sitting upright in the jeep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe kept the scene secure until other law enforcement agencies arrived and Greg advised the chain of command of the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cleared the scene at 21:30 hours.\\r\\n','jason.murvine@ncparks.gov','330-714-7249','','MOMO','SODI','','2015-07-25','','','','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Murvine6406,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(61,'AN_061','2015','Award Presentation Complete','2','Cristical Incident Stress Debriefing Team- Angelia Allcox, Peter Mitchell, Jane Conolly, Kelly King, Lee Amos, John Shell, Karen Johnson','Team members have volunteered to take on this additional duty to help their fellow staff members through tragedies that take place in our parks.

By the fall of 2006, its presence was confirmed from the Dumont Road access all the way to Guess Road â€“ nearly 14 miles, the entire length of the park.   Hydrilla is a major threat to the ecology and the recreational aspects of waterways and it rapidly clogged up the Eno River.  Canoeing, fishing, and swimming became difficult and unpleasant.  There was great concern for the effect on native plant life depended on by both rare and common aquatic creatures and for waterfowl due to the potential of disease associated with the Hydrilla.  The NC Wildlife Resources Commission had to end their Roanoke Bass study as the Hydrilla interfered with their ability to inventory.rnPark and Natural Resource Management section staff sought answers through other state agencies, but the difficulty of controlling Hydrilla in an open flowing environment stymied everyone.  For years, no traction was gained on control and the problem worsened.rnKeith Nealson inherited and began working on this problem when he became Eno River State Park Superintendent in 2008.  One of the greatest hurdles to Hydrilla management, beyond the technical difficulties, was the large number of stakeholders on the river.  There was a mixture of local, state, and federal agencies, who all recognized and wanted to solve the problem, but no-one stepped forward to take charge or even knew who should take charge of finding a solution.  This is when Keith stepped in and became the catalyst for organizing the Eno River Hydrilla Task Force.rnKeith became the driving force of keeping the issue in front of the agencies, authorities, and sections who needed to be involved to collectively succeed at finding and implementing a solution.  He sought out and motivated those that needed to be involved, followed through on the efforts needed, and provided the communications to this disparate group.  He pulled the appropriate agencies together to meet face to face and in 2012 the task force first met with representatives from DPR, NC DWR, NC WRC, NC NHP, US Fish and Wildlife Service, NCSU, The Town of Hillsborough Public Utilities, the City of Raleigh Public Utilities, Orange-Alamance Water Systems, USACE-Falls Lake, NCDA&CS Noxious Weed Program, and the Eno River Association.  Since then the task force has grown to add Durham and Wake Counties and 45 people.  For the next couple of years Keith provided the leadership at the meetings of the task force before turning it over to the DPR Natural Resources Section.rnThe task force has been a team effort as has all the experimentation and the eventual control plan and implementation.  But someone had to shepherd it, and that was Keith Nealson.  He has been personally involved with all the surveys of the problem, getting the scientists to where they need to go, helping everyone find the plants and animals that need to be monitored and experimented on, guided the logistics for experimentation, and making sure all the key task force members stayed informed.   Keith personally led and organized the experiment to try hand pulling the Hydrilla with over 300 hours of work with volunteers.  He was the key person for community information, relations, and education until an educational subcommittee was formed in 2014 and then he continued in an active role on that sub-committee.  The educational efforts were critical to success as the approach narrowed to putting herbicide in the river that served as both drinking water and recreational waters for hundreds of thousands of people.rnIn 2015 the task force implemented its Hydrilla management strategy of releasing low doses of fluridone.  Keith found them a location in the up-river reaches of the park where they had required access but was remote enough that there was little chance of public interference.  Originally the plan was for DWR Aquatic Weed Control Program staff to manage the mechanics of the pumping equipment but they were unable and Keith and the park staff stepped up and have been at a minimum weekly taking care of and monitoring the equipment.  The fluridone has had a remarkable effect on knocking down the Hydrilla.  When concerns rose as to the effect the fluridone was having a native vegetation Keith both monitored and reported the concerns, leading to adjustments in the plan.rnThe Eno River Hydrilla Task Force would not have been successful without all of the team members.  But in any organization there has to be someone who is passionate and committed to the cause and has the leadership skills to make things happen.  Keith Nealson was that person, being a stalwart through pessimism, obstacles, and government bureaucracy.  He did this during a time when his park staff was severely reduced and park operations significantly increased.  He learned the names and roles of everyone on the task force and developed a good working relationship with each one. He remained positive and persevered and deserves recognition of a DPR special achievement award. rn','dave.cook@ncparks.gov','(919)841-4059','','NODI','NODI','','2015-08-03','','','','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Cook4712,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(72,'AN_072','2015','Award Presentation Complete','5','Scott Avis and David Mumford','On 10-11-14 Scott Avis and David Mumford responded to an unresponsive woman at the Beaverdam boat ramp.

Rather than use funds from the parkâ€™s operation budget to purchase a premade box for $600, Mr. Barnwell made use of scrap steel and plastic from previous projects to build one in-house and at no cost to the State. rnMr. Barnwell not only came up with an innovative design to accommodate the parkâ€™s unique requirements, he repurposed leftover metal from maintenance projects, metal signs, and plastic signs from the Divisionâ€™s own sign shop to build a box as sturdy and accessible as is sold by vendors. The box provides a convenient place for groups of rock climbers and boulderers to deposit their Special Activity Permit applications and fees, saving them the trouble of crossing the gorge to do the same at the state parkâ€™s office. The box itself securely holds the funds until patrolling rangers can empty the box, and it increases the probability of climbing groups following Division regulations and not getting cited for illegal activity.rnMr. Barnwell performed above expectations on his project to build a metal outdoor fee collection box, and his work provided savings to the state and better customer service to our visitors.

The Weed Action Coalition of the Hickory Nut Gorge (WAC-HNG) is one of those rare entities in the world of stewardship where a cooperative public-private initiative has consistently exceeded expectations and has yielded meaningful and lasting results on a landscape scale.  The 66,000 acre watershed that is WAC-HNGâ€™s focus encompasses the Hickory Nut Gorge around Lake Lure and is notable for protecting over 50 rare species in some of North Carolinaâ€™s highest quality habitats.  rnWAC-HNG was initiated in 2010 following the recognition by the Friends of the Hickory Nut Gorge that invasive species constituted a major threat to the gorgeâ€™s recreational, ecological, scenic, and economic values.  The mission statement is simple:  To identify, remove, and prevent the future proliferation of non-native invasive species in the Hickory Nut Gorge watershed in order to preserve its biological diversity, health, and scenic beauty.  rnFunded by a series of grants and powered by an unusually diverse and active coalition of over a dozen local, state, federal, and private civic, conservation, and land stewardship agencies, the coalition hired a coordinator in 2012, and by 2013 a 5-year strategic plan was in place.  rnWith a strong emphasis on inventory and monitoring, invasive species treatments, and public education and outreach, the coalition has leveraged cooperation between all of the partners and a wide array of volunteers in order to significantly expand the capacity for invasive species management on a landscape scale on both public and private lands.  To date, the coalition has inventoried and mapped invasive species on over 3,200 acres, it has treated nearly 500 acres, and it has produced over a dozen site management plans for public and private land holders.  Public exposure through multiple media sources has been consistently positive, and it is clear that WAC-HNG has raised stewardship awareness and action to levels never previously seen on this landscape.  rnWAC-HNGâ€™s work at Chimney Rock State Park has been a model of success that is unmatched across the state park system.  Since 2013, WAC-HNG has spent over $40,000 and devoted over 1,000 hours of labor while treating over 200 acres of state park property.  Highlights include inventorying and mapping park property, developing treatment protocols, hiring work crews from the American Conservation Experience, coordinating volunteers, and providing all of the herbicides.  In 2015, WAC-HNG contracted with the park, Chimney Rock LLC, and the Friends of the Hickory Nut Gorge to use goats to begin treatment on the parkâ€™s extensive kudzu infestations.  The use of goats is a landmark advance in invasive species management at the park and would likely have been impossible without WAC-HNGâ€™s involvement.  rnWAC-HNG consists of only three employees, all of whom work tirelessly with homeowners, businesses, private and public land owners, and volunteers in order to advance the cause of stewardship, regardless of ownership.  The skill and devotion of this organization, and particularly its value to stewardship on state park properties, cannot be overstated.  Without WAC-HNGâ€™s support, invasive species management at Chimney Rock State Park would have been immensely more difficult and almost certainly less successful.  rnrnContact Debbie Shetterly (828)-625-9983 EXT 506 rn','matthew.haynes@ncparks.gov','828-625-1823','','CHRO','WEDI','','2015-08-15','','','','','No','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Haynes2868,Haynes2868,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841','','','','uploads/2015/AN_078_other_file_3_9792.docx',''),(79,'AN_079','2015','DENIED pending review - comments below','2','Bob Martin','Bob Martin, a seasonal GUW at CRMO, was recently required to go above and beyond the scope of his normal duties and performed admirably.  On Saturday, August 29, 2015 around 1520 hours seasonal park office assistant staff received a call that there was an injured hiker, near the summit of the Pinnacle, who had heard a \\\"pop\\\" in her left ankle after tripping.  Both Ranger staff on the park were tied up with a domestic dispute on the summit of Crowders Mountain (four miles away as a crow flies).  Ranger Dan Tenney determined that Bob, who had been trained in Gator use, could drive the Gator as far as possible up the Pinnacle trail, then hike up and locate the injured party.  Bob did this, having to hike a steep .5 mile trail on a hot, humid day.  Once Bob arrived he, with the assistance of bystanders, was able to bring the victim safely to the Gator, and drive the Gator out to an awaiting Ranger and mother of the victim.  Bob handled the victim so professionally and with such care that, although the victim had probably broken her ankle, she was still smiling and laughing as she reached the end of her Gator trip.rnrnBob Martin exemplifies the spirit of NC State Parks seasonal staff; poorly paid, given difficult hours, but willingly assisting permanent staff in areas that go above and beyond their normal daily duties.

Ellis Award for excellent work done over his past three years at CHRO as lead I&E ranger. As the first advanced ranger to hold this position at the park, Stephen started from scratch, and rather than rely exclusively on the programming produced by the parkâ€™s contracted concessionaire, he led the efforts of both ranger and concessionaire staff to greatly increase participation and reach of the Divisionâ€™s mission to â€œprovide environmental education opportunities that promote stewardship of the state\\\'s natural heritage.â€ His pioneering work won the park both a sustainability award and the Silver E award in 2014, and his innovation and determination have only continued in 2015.rnWhen one looks at the I&E numbers for CHRO over the last three years, the steady increase in visitation and contact with visitors speaks for itself. Between 2012/13 and 2014/15, I&E program participation grew from 13,503 to 24,200 people, an increase of 79%. Stephen worked tirelessly to introduce the concessionaire and thereby their customers to the Divisionâ€™s annual interpretive themes, and aside from bringing in new displays and activities, Stephen encouraged his private sector colleagues to tout more natural resource protection and green innovation in their business plan. Likewise, the parkâ€™s free annual Earth Day event drew 50% more visitors and participants in 2014 than in 2012, reaching even those disinclined to pay the attractionâ€™s entrance fee. Most significantly, the number of children who earned the parkâ€™s Junior Ranger designation jumped from 25 in 2012/13 to 471 in 2014/15, a mind-boggling increase of 1784%. Stephen led CHRO ranger staff in taking ownership of the parkâ€™s educational programs, and rather than hurt the concessionaireâ€™s bottom line, visitation increased and seeds were sown for future visits to and support and conservation of state parks.rnAs a result, Ranger Stephen Tillotsonâ€™s exemplary performance of his duties as CHROâ€™s lead I&E ranger have made him a tremendous asset to the park and the education of future state parks supporters. Well aware that he could not do it alone, he forged new relationships with the parkâ€™s concessionaire, educators in four counties, and partners in recreation and conservation in order to reach increasingly large numbers of people and share with them the parkâ€™s natural wonders. Stephenâ€™s tact, encouragement, and leadership paved the way for the rest of the parkâ€™s I&E staff to follow, and he did this all in addition to his role as the parkâ€™s lead law enforcement ranger. Ripples from his positive efforts will rebound back to the park and the Division in years to come, and so we at CHRO highly recommend Stephen for the Thomas C.

But in the last two years they have tackled an enormous maintenance and beautification project which EVERY visitor to Morrow Mountain State Park views and appreciates.  Their effort have rebuilt the iconic stone wall at the entrance to Morrow Mountain State Park, saving the state $40,000.00 in the process. In this project, the Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park have brought together park staff, volunteers, multiple commercial donors, multiple individual donors, grants from Friends of State Parks, skilled craftsmen, and others to re-build two beautiful walls that perfectly frame the entrance to the park.  rnrnThe President of the Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park is Vanessa Mullinix and she has been the driving force behind the wall project.  She lives at 44588 Morrow Mountain Road, Albemarle, NC 28001 and she can be reached at (704) 983-8941. rnrnThe following account of the building of the MOMO entrance wall was written by active Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park member John Young:  rnrnFriends of Morrow Mountain State Park Wall Restoration ProjectrnrnAt meetings of Friends of Morrow Mt. State Park in late 2013 and early 2014 a number of members suggested that an ideal project for our relatively new group to tackle would be to restore the two front entrance walls.  The Civilian Conservation Corps had built those walls with dry stacked argillite stone in 1940.  The stone used at the front walls, like most all of the stone used throughout the park, were cut from argillite quarries from inside the park.rnThe original dry stacked walls had been reworked a couple of times since 1940 and some of those efforts were not up to the quality of the original CCC work.  One story has it that as the walls deteriorated someone attempted to drive over some weaker sections with a four wheel drive vehicle.  FMMSP members wanted the walls to be restored as closely as possible to the original look of dry stacked stones but also to use some newer techniques that would ensure that the walls lasted for many years.rnIn early June of 2014 the north side wall (on you left as you enter the park) restoration project began.  Volunteer labor provided by members of FMMSP, some in the community and some volunteers from the Robin Sage, Army Special Forces Qualification Program, helped take down the old argillite stone and set them to the side for the stone masons to use later.  Significant in-kind labor was donated to dig the footing for the wall and to spread the concrete.  Deanâ€™s Ready Mixed, Inc. and Pate Masonry Supply, LLC provided the concrete, sand, mortar, block, etc. at a discount for the project.  Then Rocky Parker of Rocky Parker Masonry, who also discounted his charges, began a month long project to rebuild the north wall.rnIn mid-August volunteers again did a lot of landscaping around the wall, and the extra argillite stones were moved and stored for use on future projects.  Then in late August, under the guidance of FMMSP Director, Walter Deppe all the volunteers listed above helped split, and build the cedar rail fence along the north side entrance to replace the dilapidated, old cedar rail fence.rnThis north side wall project cost $9,548.00 but when we give value to the many volunteer hours of hard work, in-kind contributions and discounts given we estimate the value of the north side project to be over $14,000.00.  The payments of $9,548.00 were made possible from our largest gift, a grant from Friends of State Parks of $3,000.00 and then major gifts from Fiberon Decking in New London and Bank of North Carolina as well as hundreds of smaller gifts from members and the community.rnThe entire process almost repeated itself starting in late June of 2015.  Once again volunteers from FMMSP and the community gathered to take down the stones on the much longer south side wall and set them to the side for Rocky Parker, the stone mason.  rnSteve Austin Landscaping contributed his labor and equipment to dig out and remove several large stumps, dig the footing and handle the concrete.  Again at a discount Deanâ€™s Ready Mix and Pate Masonry Supply provided the concrete, block, mortar, sand, etc.  Then during July and August Rocky Parker of Rocky Parker Masonry at a discount rebuilt the south wall.  In early September some initial clean-up around the wall has taken place.  The extra argillite stones are once again being removed and stored for future use.  Some significant landscape work is still needed as well as the installation of a cedar rail fence at the back of the wall so we probably have at least another $1,000.00 in plants, mulch and value assigned volunteer labor for later in September or October.rnThe south side wall project cost (note right above it is not yet finished) $16,824.00 and when we give value to the many volunteer hours, in-kind contributions and discounts given we estimate the value of the south side project to be around $23,000.00.  The payments of $16,824.00 were made possible again from our largest gift, a grant of initially $3,000, then another $2,000, for a total of $5,000.00 from Friends of State Parks.  The next largest gift was given by Culp Lumber followed by a gift from Bank of Stanly as well as hundreds of smaller gifts from members and the community.rnOur estimate is that Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park has with direct money, volunteer labor, in-kind contributions and discounts from contractors created a fully restored front entrance on both the north and south sides that has a value of over $37,000.00.   All during the project on both walls it was FMMSP Board Chairman, Vanessa Mullinix, who organized the volunteer labor, contacted the contractors and directly raised most of the major gifts.  Her efforts were extraordinary.  The efforts involved many folks but the greatest thanks must go to the Friends of State Parks and their grants totaling $8,000.00 that made this wall restoration project a reality.rnrnrnThis summary of the wall restoration project was prepared by John D.

Chanda quickly developed a process for managing the entries and was able to keep up with over 2,000 photos for each contest.  She knows that people want a quick response to their entry and she worked hard to keep up with them.  She never allowed this additional work to delay any of her other deadlines or projects.rnrnChandaâ€™s computer skills are a marvel to those of us who are technologically challenged, but her personal skills and her desire to always make a positive experience for someone else makes her one of a kind.rnrnNot only does she keep up with all of the photos and the technical aspects of the task, but she gets to know the contestants individually.  When Chanda saw that a little girl had taken the initiate to make sea turtle tracks in the sand because she could not find any actual tracks for her photo, Chanda knew that she wanted to do something special for the girl.  The girl got a bandana for her efforts and Chanda remembers her name, to this day.  Another familyâ€™s adventure into NC State Parks began with the first Scavenger Hunt: they submitted entries for nine parks.  Their daughter then went on to earn 11 Junior Ranger patches and discovered TRACK Trails along the way.  This eight year old is now participating in a community service project at Lake James State Park.  I have to believe that Chandaâ€™s positive attitude and competent organization of the scavenger hunt had an influence on the familyâ€™s desire to pursue these opportunities.  A colleague has said that she is happy that Chanda is the â€˜face of the Scavenger Huntâ€™ because she is such a positive representation of state parks.  I couldnâ€™t agree more.rnrnTo keep the Scavenger hunt â€˜aliveâ€™ for all park staff, Chanda sent out some of the best photos so that we could all enjoy them and know that we were each an active part of the event.

These four leaders have spearheaded a massive rehabilitation effort at Falls Lake State Recreation Area involving both Operating Budget and Major Maintenance Funds that resulted in extensive financial savings in our energy budget, increased efficiency in water usage, and increased visitor satisfaction.rnrnMr. Barbour, while maintaining responsibility for infrastructure, building, and grounds maintenance of a highly popular, 162 site Campground, led the planning and execution of the installation of high efficiency tankless water heaters throughout Falls Lake State Recreation Area.  He personally installed seven heaters in five buildings in Hollypoint Campground.  Due to his innovative design, use of modern technology, and extensive knowledge of electrical and plumbing systems, standardization of installation throughout the entire Falls Lake Recreation Area shower house system was achieved.  This has resulted in ten out of twelve shower houses converted in less than a yearâ€™s time with the last two scheduled to be completed in the next year.    This modernization effort, due in large part to his analysis of past and present energy and water use, has shown a 10-20 per cent decrease in both energy costs and water consumption.  In keeping with the mission of the State Park system, the move from electrical to clean gas power demonstrates his commitment to environmental concerns. rn rnMr. Grimes, who is leaned on for advise in many areas of concern to Park Maintenance staff, led an effort to update our thirty year old bathroom buildings.  Mr. Grimes is responsible for a large multi-use facility including a highly visited day use area, a 117 site family campground, a four site group campground, and a very highly popular community building.  His shower curtain and tiling ideas and execution have brought many favorable responses from campground visitors.  He designed the plan for tiling that will be used in all shower houses throughout the Park camping areas.  This has led to decreased time spent scrubbing concrete block walls in the showers with more efficient cleaning of the tile surface.  In addition to his ingenuity with the tiling project, done completely within Park operating budget, he has been a leader in the Parkâ€™s conversion to LED lighting.  This new lighting plan allows for less maintenance time, longer bulb lifetime, increased visibility in shower house and parking areas, and savings in our energy budget. Additionally, through his innovation we have decreased chemical use in cleaning our bathroom facilities, decreased energy use, and increased visitor satisfaction in keeping with the Divisionâ€™s mission.rnrnMr. Parkerâ€™s demonstrated commitment to Falls Lake is evident from the lack of downtime on our small engine equipment inventory.  Falls Lake does not have a small engine mechanic and he has gladly taken on this invaluable job as a collateral duty.  In addition to being responsible for an eleven site group campground and a multi-use campground with seven groups sites and 47 hike in sites, he manages an inventory of 13 riding lawnmowers, 40 weedeaters, blowers, and edgers, and a multitude of chainsaws.  Mr. Parker is also the pump expert on our highly used pumper units utilized for over 600 acres of prescribed burns in the last year.  He also is responsible for the grounds maintenance of his designated campgrounds, the park office and maintenance area, and the Piedmont Regional Office located at the Yorkshire Building in Raleigh.  He is leaned on heavily as a training asset at the park and beyond.  He teaches annual CPR Refresher classes and is also a division chainsaw instructor.  At monthly staff meetings he is commonly called upon to conduct safety and operational training of park equipment.  Mr. Parkerâ€™s commitment to safety, training, and efficient use of operating budget shows his dedication to Division priorities and mission.rnrnMr. Husketh is responsible for three highly popular day use areas.  This includes 15 reservable picnic shelters, two boat ramps, two fishing piers and a large spillway/fishing area.  This area also includes an enormous amount of picnic pads which he has rehabilitated in an outstanding manner.  He reclaimed three very seldom used picnic areas in the Beaverdam Day Use Facility by replacing tables, grills, thinning out overgrown brush, and opening up overgrown trail areas.  These areas now have signage indicating their location and have grown very popular over the last year.  He has also led our efforts at standardization of bathroom facilities.  Realizing we still used many high flow fixtures in our bathrooms, he designed a plan and materials list to replace everything with low flow or waterless fixtures.  He set the standards throughout the park with commodes, low flow flush valves, waterless urinals and low flow aerated sink fixtures.  He completed interior renovations on 8 bathroom facilities over the last year, upgrading electrical systems, painting the interiors, replacing all the fixtures, and upgrading lighting with LED fixtures and bulbs.  Another 8 facilities are planned for completion in the next year.  His commitment to customer service, water conservation and energy efficiency reflect well upon the Divisionâ€™s Mission.rn','vincent.shea@ncparks.gov','919-604-3989','I think there needs to be a separate award recommendation for each employee, since they worked on unique projects.

Because of his dedication and efforts, the program has grown tremendously over time and now is led by park staff.  People from multiple agencies and organizations now come to observe and learn from NC State Park staff including New River Conservancy, NC Zoo, NC WRC, Davidson College, NCSU, ASU, UNC-Chapel Hill, Clemson, and others.  Techniques and partnerships have developed and grown that changed surveys that began finding a few individual in a week, to a record year in 2016 of over 70 individuals identified.  Animals are PIT tagged, scientific data collected, and samples taken for testing.  This has resulted in multiple findings of mudpuppies that were thought not to exist in this area of the watershed.rnrnEfforts have not been exclusive to the survey work.  Doug has also been the catalyst for public education of the eastern hellbender by developing information displays along the New River, a partnership with New River Conservancy to provide placards to promote the education of the public and protection of the eastern hellbender, creation of â€œSnottyâ€ the Snot Otter, a life-size mascot costume used in festivals and different events around the state, and New River Celebration Day that promotes action to protect the river utilizing the eastern hellbender as the poster child of the event.rnrnHis efforts have had a tremendous impact on the eastern hellbender, New River State Park, and NC Division of Parks and Recreation.rn','joseph.shimel@ncparks.gov','3369822587','','NERI','WEDI','','2016-10-09','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','Yes','0000-00-00','','Shimel1060,Shimel1060,Tillotson5212,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Blanchard3795,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(91,'AN_091','2016','DENIED pending review - comments below','2','Justin Allen','Over the course of the summer a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes work goes into making Lake James State Park presentable for the multitudes of visitors here to have outdoor fun. The maintenance staff and rangers can\\\'t do it on top of their regular daily duties and that\\\'s why the state park relies so heavily on its seasonal grounds-keeping crew. rnrnFrom before the time the gates open until long after most visitors have left for home, seasonal workers are scouring the park; picking up litter, removing ashes from campsite and picnic grills, addressing overflowing trash and recycling bins, cleaning bathrooms and shower houses, grooming the beach sand, and mowing and weed-eating the road shoulders and lawns. rnrnAmong LAJA\\\'s dedicated six-person all-star team is Justin Allen. To say Justin is passionate about the park would be an understatement. Several years ago he studied YouTube videos on how to mow stripes into lawns. The grass behind the Paddy\\\'s Creek bathhouse has looked like a major league outfield ever since. When he\\\'s not riding a mower or strapped to a weed-eater, Justin works tirelessly on all of the other park chores. He\\\'s even been known to volunteer his services when he\\\'s not on the payroll. This is the reason I am nominating Justin for a Special Achievement Award. When we weren\\\'t able to hire Justin back as early as usual this past spring, due to seasonal funding constraints, Justin volunteered to mow the park for free for during the month of May, accumulating 92 volunteer hours. This was such a tremendous help as we were pressed to get our new campground ready to open along with getting the rest of the park ready for the busy season. LAJA would be at a loss without Justin and we hope to show our gratitude with this award. rnrn','nora.coffey@ncparks.gov','828-584-7728','','LAJA','WEDI','','2016-10-11','','','Yes','','Yes','No','Yes','','','','No','0000-00-00','','McGrath9695,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Bash8938,Blanchard3795,Blanchard3795,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(92,'AN_092','2016','Award Granted','2','Chandra Siler, CHRO and APC Chair','For taking on the responsibility of the First NC State Park Photo Scavenger Hunt Challenge as proposed by Sean Higgins, I & E.Sean was in need of someone in the division with the interest and skills to communicate, announce, and track a public challenge to state park visitors for photographs to be awarded prizes as they visited statewide parks and took interesting photos in compliance with the Scavenger Hunt photo guidelines and Chanda Siler was nominated by the APC and accepted this new challenge with professionalism and a genuine interest in the First NC State Park Photo Scavenger Hunt tracking, uploading photos, designing unique posters and sending frequent emails and links to follow. rnrnI nominate Chanda Siler, hands down because now we have an annual interesting event to offer park visitors that include children and adults.

If this trail has been contracted out it would have cost DPR over 77,000.00 and that is a conservative estimate. This trail brings the total trail mileage at PIMO to 28.5 miles and creates a new remote trailhead at the Park\'s new Pilot Creek Access to take pressure of the internal trail system of the mountain. This also fulfills a often requested visitor wish for a uncrowded, longer hike that reaches the rest of the park\'s trail system.

I began overseeing the CPR program in February, 2014 and during that time, Walt has never hesitated in either taking lead or assisting with a CPR class when called upon.  There were many times I would contact Walt at the last minute to see if he was available to teach a class, and it was extremely rare to hear that he couldnâ€™t teach.  He doesnâ€™t complain if he has to change his days off or work a long shift in order to cover a much-needed CPR course.  rnAs a divisional mandate, all rangers, maintenance mechanics and superintendents are required to attend a Basic Life Support CPR class each year.  Throughout the state, there are 14 CPR instructors striving to hold enough classes for all employees to fulfill their CPR classes.  The American Heart Association started using a database to enter all classes in February 2014.  Since that time, we have taught a total of 153 classes covering as much of the state as possible.  Of these, Walt has either led or assisted with 22 classes.  He has traveled to taught at FALA, ENRI, HARI, MARI, PIMO, HARO, RARO, MOMO, and CRMO to name a few.rnIâ€™ve taught many of these classes with Walt and I truly appreciate how he will tailor his teaching style to the audience.  He has assisted me each year with teaching our large seasonal staff at HARI.  The course that we teach is a step down from Basic Life Support and Walt changes his teaching style to fit the class.  Iâ€™ve never seen him make students feel inferior when they ask an off-the-wall question or perform their skills completely wrong.  Instead, he is professional and works with the student with patience and understanding.  I can honestly say that with having Walt as an instructor, my task as the CPR coordinator is lighter, knowing I can call and heâ€™ll be there.

Maness had spoken to the camper earlier about his troubled home life and she said she had a \'sense\' that he was outside in need of help. When she exited her RV to check her hunch, she saw him stumbling incoherently and assisted him in getting back to his campsite. Koch found the camper laying unconscious in the woods below a campsite. Koch administered narcan to the patient who lost pulse and stopped breathing as Koch was assessing him. He also performed CPR using his pocket mask, and later, rescue breaths to the patient as he began to revive. Sam\'s quick thinking, quick actions, adherence to training he had received, and bravery is the only reason the patient is alive. Koch was alone when he administered the narcan and CPR. He was joined shortly after by ranger Jason Anthony, who had been home listening to the radio. Anthony heard Koch and the host\'s radio traffic and assisted by providing a bag valve mask to continue rescue breaths. Anthony routinely listens to the radio on his time off, since we are short staffed and often work alone at night.

However, Anthony, against reason,  decided to check the Hanging Rock trail for the vehicle operator. He walked to the top of the rock formation at the trail terminus and saw a backpack on the edge. He looked around but could not see anyone. He called Rangers Sam Koch, Mary Griffin, Austin Paul and superintendent Riddlebarger to come in and help him search. It was extremely windy and dark and Anthony suspected the owner of the backpack had fallen off the rock formation. Park staff came back on duty and began searching park wide. Shortly after Koch arrived at the base of the formation he found the victim badly injured. She had fallen 115 feet through a tree and had landed on a fence. Paul and Griffin joined them and they gave care to the patient. They transported the patient by stokes basket to the EMS and then the patient was flown by air care to the hospital. rnrnOn February 18, 2017 less than two weeks after the fall described above, another person fell 40 feet  from the same rock formation near where the other fall had taken place. Ranger Paul was on duty and responded to the call from 911. He and ranger Anthony provided care for the patient until EMS could arrive and take over care. The patient was flown by air care to the hospital. This patient landed on a rock ledge and a few weeks later died from his injuries. rnrnTwo critically injured patients in one month, in February, our traditionally least-visited month.

On top of dealing with normal everyday park operations, Patricia and Cliff spend untold hours working on logistics and planning on TOP of their ever-increasing park roles.  With park visitation and retail operations both growing at an average rate of 25+% over 2016 figures, Patricia and Cliff still found time to take on countless new and challenging roles related to the Eclipse Weekends Events.    Attended weekly Friday afternoon, for months (Mar. â€“ Aug), to discuss and prepare for the Eclipse Weekend became a regular  part of life! rnrnBob & Miki have a combined total of 336 hours of volunteering, just in August alone, preparing for this huge celebration weekend.  The true time preparing for this event from Jan. to Aug is known and truly under estimated on the database. rnBob & Miki attended The State Friends Group meeting to make a personal plea for grants which would be used to purchase eclipse glasses to be given out free to park guest, and for funding for technical support to provide live streaming and video taping of the eclipse.  rnBob & Miki working alongside Patricia and Cliff coordinated with local vendors, exhibitors, programmers, food trucks, music, and much more to ensure everyone had the space and facilities they needed throughout the weekendâ€™s events. Bob personally made sure that all necessary permits (State Park, & County Health Dept) were  properly submitted.  rnBob, Miki, Patricia and Cliff also made sure that volunteers were well taken care of.   This include, Cliff providing adequate electrical service for volunteers camping at the park, Patricia making sure all volunteers ad t-shirt and safety, Bob & Miki making sure that all volunteers and staff were well fed and hydrated.  They provided each volunteer and staff member with a lunch voucher that was redeemable at any of the food trucks, also an elaborate refreshment stand that accommodated park staff, vendors, and volunteers.  rnBob created the logo that was used on many things such as the parks website, and the handout that went into the eclipse packets.  Bob also created the rack card that displayed important safety information about the eclipse weekend.  Patricia then used this same artwork on custom Eclipse shirts.  Bob also served as the  point of contact for all the interested volunteers, and coordinated with them to find out how they could best help.

These three dedicated employees have been and continue doing the work that once took four people to complete.  They do their jobs in a time of ever increasing complexity of park operations, growth of park attendance and number of parks, and large developments such as the many Connect NC Bond projects.  Due to all these complexities and growth in park operations one could easily argue that their responsibilities could be best handled by five regional superintendents.  rnrnField staff numbers are not increasing in concert with the increasing attendance, park acreage, capital improvements, services expected of field staff from administration and the public, and a general rise in the complexity of park operations.  These demands placed on the field staff have a negative effect on morale.  Jay, John, and Sean provide leadership and problem solving solutions to the field staff often guiding us through state bureaucracy.  They always put forth a positive attitude that helps bolster field staff morale.   rnrnJay, John, and/or Sean responded effectively to the wildfires of 2016 and/or Hurricane Matthew demonstrating leadership, teamwork, and responsiveness to the needs of the parks and employees under their supervision during these disasters.  Both disasters were large in scale and complexity.  These three regional superintendents put in extremely long hours over many weeks during and after the disasters.  They are attempting to learn from these disasters and put into practice changes that will make the next disaster responses more effective.rnrnDespite all these challenges and demands these three regional superintendents continue to work towards all aspects of our Mission Statement.

Tom retired years ago after a 30-year career as a District I&E Specialist.  He is a naturalist in the true use of that word.  Tom has an excellent memory and used it to great effect in his knowledge and understanding of the diversity and complexity NCâ€™s flora, fauna, ecology, cultural history, and so much more.  I suspect he could still identify more on a hike in the woods than five or six of us combined.  He spent years teaching many rangers how to be effective interpreters and educators.  I still remember Tom Howard training sessions I attended more than 20 years ago because he had the gift of extensive knowledge and the ability to make meaningful connections.  I sometimes think it is sad that Tom is not still teaching rangers how to teach.  He has presented I&E programs to many thousands of park visitors and fostered in many a love of nature and a desire to be good stewards of our natural resources.  Tom has fought and won many battles during his career to keep DPR true to our Mission Statement.  rnrnIt is my understanding that Tomâ€™s current job as our computer programming and database creator is a seasonal position.  Tomâ€™s skills with programming computers could make him a great deal more money in the private sector than he makes as a seasonal.  He does his job with DPR out of a sense purpose and dedication to state parks and our Mission Statement.  rnrnLetâ€™s take the NRID as one example.  Some years ago, I was at a conference with people from many other SE state park systems.  Tom did a presentation on the NRID and other databases. I was in the room with about 20 other people.  The people present from other state park systems were amazed and almost speechless as Tom discussed the features of the NRID.  One person leaned over and whispered in my ear, â€œThis is unbelievable.  I canâ€™t imagine my state ever having anything as great as this.â€  Let me remind you the goal of the NRID is to document every living thing in every state park.  This database is well reasoned, effective to use, and documents much critical information.  The first and most important step in protecting our state parkâ€™s natural resources is to know what those resources are and to document them in a formal system.  The NRID does this and much more.  rnrnTomâ€™s database system is how DPR conducts most our business and is vital to our ability to function daily, monthly, yearly and beyond.  Tomâ€™s efforts have brought DPR into the modern age of computer based everything.  I am using one of his databases right now to nominate him for this award.  I do not think it would be possible for DPR to be where we are today without Tomâ€™s relentless, creative and tireless work.  His efforts span all many years of dedicated service as well as all areas of the Thomas C. Ellis Award.  Every word of the Awardâ€™s description applies to Tom Howard for his past and present dedicated years of service.

On two occasions now, Kyle has been willing to take time out of his evenings to assist with honey bee removal.  The first time was two years ago when we had a swarm land right off the sidewalk at our 100 cottage unit.  I called Kyle that afternoon to tell him what we had and that night he came with a honey bee box and carefully transferred the swarm to the hive.  The second instance took place this summer.  We had a queen set up a hive inside the covered walkway leading into the round building.  Due to the decline of the honey bee, I didn\'t want to bring an exterminator in, so I called Kyle to get his advice.  The next night he was out at the park looking at the location and determining the best way to remove the bees.  He then spent several nights erecting a stand for an empty box with used frames.  He enclosed the entrance to the bee hive and set up a pipe with a net over the end of it so the bees could leave, but not get back in.

Jeff researched, planned and mapped the various park routes in order to make the many diverse habitats accessible to the visiting public, while causing the least impact to the park\'s living resources.rnrnFast forward nearly 25 years and Jeff is still leading the way at CABE w/ innovative trail development that canvasses most of the park properties, and the hard, sweaty work that help the trail ideas become a reality.rnrnIn FY 2015-16, Jeff led the development and dedication of one of the first Fitness Trails in North Carolina State Parks. The work of eagle scouts, volunteers and a grant from local industry, GE allowed for eight (8) separate workout stations to be installed along the one-mile accessible trail, all w/ Jeff\'s positive leadership and attention to detail. The underlying textile fabric and 8 inches of \"crush and run\" material through the pine woods create a flat, smooth surface for the long haul and creates a use for bicyclists that was previously unavailable. Personally, I have heard the testimonials of no fewer than five (5) people that attribute their recent weight loss and improvement of personal health to their use of the Fitness Trail and in turn are appreciative of Jeff\'s role in creating this facility so conveniently located near the Town of Carolina Beach\'s own Parks and Recreation Center. Many would rest on such an achievement, but Jeff\'s character is to turn and seek the next challenge. Two (2) new trail projects came his way in FY 2016-17 with the extending an refurbishing of the Snow\'s Cut Trail and the development of the totally new Sand Live Oak Trail.rnrnThe Snow\'s Cut Trail improvement project was a matter of making an existing trail route a more official part of the park\'s trail system with better signage and mapping. The route also provided another method for park visitors to tie into the Town of Carolina Beach\'s own greenway, bike path. The area is widely used by fishermen, and specifically those of Hispanic origins. Jeff takes the cleanliness and safety of these trail areas personal, above and beyond his work role. New trash receptacles have been installed here and Jeff has even advocated Spanish-language signage here through the help of his Colombian-born wife.rnrnSand Live Oak Trail has been developed in the extreme southern sections of the park and added another 1.5 miles to the CABE trail system. At 761 acres, CABE is one of the smallest NC State Parks in land acreage, but w/ the growth of Wilmington and over 750K visitors over the last fiscal year, its easy to see that folks are constantly looking for green space and a place to stretch their legs. In this extension of the already popular Sugarloaf Trail, Jeff\'s design tied together sections of old jeep roads w/ side trails and new connector sections to take the hiker around small, hidden brackish marshes, under the dappled shade of riverside sand live oaks and back around and across the dry, rolling desert-like landscape over relic sand dunes that form the highest topography of New Hanover County. Rave reviews of this trail is already being heard. Hikers explored these sections previously, but Jeff\'s route gets the trail on the map, gets more \"eyes\" out in this section of property that is leased from the Department of Defense through MOTSU-Sunny Point. The development of this trail actually makes the park safer by giving rangers better access to potential injured visitors, and also waypoints, signage and directional help in getting back to the previously developed trails of Carolina Beach State Park.rnrnJeff doesn\'t ignore the fact that trails \"tire out\" from constant use and he often looks for ways to reroute or restore old trail sections. Future visitors will be indebted to Jeff Davis\'s hard work and wise planning for making the Carolina Beach State Park trail system a jewel of coastal North Carolina. Jeff was a mere child when starting his career at Carolina Beach State Park and has literally spend a park lifetime of creating paths of discovery for our park visitors. These are just a few of the reasons that I nominate him for this DPR Special Achievement Award. rnrn(On attached pdf Map - red sections indicate Jeff\'s direct trail planning and development)rn(Word Doc justification attached as File A)rnrn','j.chris.helms@ncparks.gov','(910) 619-7358','','CABE','SODI','CORE','2017-09-12','','Has he received a Distinguished Service Award?

Despite an active prescribed fire program, there was no way to prepare for the historic drought conditions that spread throughout the region including SOMO.  With so many fires occurring simultaneously, there were very little available resources to respond.  Jonathan led his staff on most of the suppression activities during the initial attack with very little support.  Jonathan went on to work every day for a three week stretch and over 300 hours throughout the course of the fire.  Jonathanâ€™s commitment to his park and to his staff meant that he was often the first one in the mornings and the last one to leave in the evenings; making sure his staff and volunteers were alright and were being taken care of everyday.

A tremendous amount of planning and execution preceding this date to get the park looking as good as it ever has for our \"guests\" took place along with arranging artisans, craftsmen, and a bluegrass band to set up and demonstrate their skills. A large 30\' x 75\' tent, 17 tables, 136 chairs, 3 port-a-johns, 2 hand washing stations, were set up the day before. The food was being prepared by both a caterer and the Maintenance Mechanics from MEMO.rnOn Monday, October 23rd at 5:30 pm a major storm came through the area, including the park, spawning at least two tornadoes and a lot of straight line wind damage throughout the park and the Wilkes/Alleghany County areas. By 6:30 pm the winds had subsided enough to get out and survey the damage, this is when the staff demonstrated what they are made of. Park Rangers came back in to begin the clearing of fallen trees and other debris. They started by clearing the public highway from the campground down John P. Frank Parkway to Traphill Rd. rnThey then started on the main road through the park working their way to the Hutchinson Homestead. They finally reached the Homestead at 10:30 pm to discover that the large tent was completely destroyed and the port-a-johns turned over. The storm had knocked out all the power and telephone service throughout the park and surrounding areas.rnThe morning of October 24th the entire staff, office manager, rangers, maintenance, and seasonal, came together, assignments were handed out, and everyone began the process of cleaning up and preparing for the upcoming luncheon. The park was closed to the public due to all the safety issues, help was summoned and the LANO crew came in to assist. The staff split up with a few going up to the Homestead and the rest clearing the 6 mile park road and roadsides of debris and eliminating immediate safety issues such as hanging limbs and trees leaning that could fall onto the road. The staff going to the Homestead worked at lifting the tent enough to get out the tables and chairs from underneath. rnIt had turned out to be a beautiful fall day and the decision was made to set everything up in the field in front of the tent. By 11:30 am the tables and chairs had been set in place, tablecloths, centerpieces including a pumpkin placed on each table, the port-a-johns and hand washing stations set back in place, the pig cooker set up and the caterer in place. rnOnly because the entire staff came together and worked as a team (many on overtime), towards a common goal, in 4 short hours they were able to host a luncheon for 116 attendees and turn what seemed to be a disaster into a luncheon many will not soon forget. It is also worth noting that the campground remained open and was filled to capacity providing even more responsibilities that needed to be met.                rnThe STMO staff were as follows; Office Manager â€“ Denise McGrady.

Fire has always been needed but rarely implemented at STMO. This past year the park accomplished what has been years in the planning, a 611-acre fire right over some of the most visited areas of the park.  In cooperation with the NC Forest Service the park accommodated and assisted on a truly extraordinary and highly visible-to-the-public aerial ignition fire.  This comes on the heals of regular ignitions over tha last few years including an unprecedented multi-agency fire adjacent to the Blue Ridge Parkway. Their fire program represents the biggest turn around of a fire program in the mountains and perhaps the entire system.   \r\n\r\nOn other fronts the park has controlled several major invasive species infestations that have been nibbled at for literally decades. Bamboo, multi-flora rose, kudzu, and Chinese silvergrass all have been heavily impacted by the work of ranger Michael Wood. The park accommodated a huge stream restoration project this year.  It is not easy to deal with all the issues that accompany having back hoes working in a very popular trout stream but the park handles\r\nd all of the public relations and infrastructure coordination efforts that resulted in a truly beautiful stream restoration.

Included in these events and incident planning, was the transition from four Districts to three Regions.\r\nCoordinating the responses to major natural disasters requires significant planning and administration.  Whether itâ€™s making hotel reservations, funding meals and ordering supplies; there are things that simply cannot be accomplished â€œon the ground,â€ and require competent administrative skills.  These tasks were handled almost exclusively by Julie, especially during the initial attack for both the Party Rock and Chestnut Knob fires.  Julie worked long hours and weekends providing the necessary assistance for the fire responses.  For the first time, the Division paid overtime for incident response.  The record keeping, time sheet tracking and payroll documentation was coordinated entirely by Julie.  If it werenâ€™t for Julieâ€™s oversight, the overtime payout would have been much more difficult to coordinate.\r\nPlanning for major events like the Centennial, the Eclipse, ASSPD conference and the Mountain State Fairs requires a tremendous amount of time and coordination.  But Julieâ€™s involvement doesnâ€™t end with simply planning the events.  Julie also volunteered and worked at the Mountain State Fair and the Great American Solar Eclipse Event, which has been typical of Julieâ€™s career with parks.

Martin','In May, June and July of 2017, Jordan Lake experienced a rash of vehicle B&Eâ€™s and the fraudulent use of credit cards at various stores around the immediate area.  This activity cost the victims many thousands of dollars in repairs and replacement of property.  Ranger Martin took the lead in the investigation and took the time to contact lost prevention officers, talk with the victims and obtain surveillance video from multiple places.  By doing this, Ranger Martin could identify a suspect vehicle.  Ranger Martin talked with other parks (LANO, MOMO, and RARO) and found that similar vehicle break-ins were done there as well.  Staff at Lake Norman could produce a possible suspect name, Mr. Sean Brady.  With this information, Ranger Martin put out a park BOLO and contacted detectives with Chatham County to assist him in the investigation.  With their help, the suspectâ€™s social media accounts were checked where photos of a similar vehicle and suspect were discovered.   Ranger Martin, after many days of investigatory work, contacted and met with the county magistrate and District attorney resulting in felony charges and an arrest warrant being issued for Mr. Brady.  Ranger Martin gave grand jury testimony several times which resulted in an indictment against Mr. Brady for approximately 30 felony charges.  Once these charges were brought, the number of break-ins that occurred in the park dramatically dropped.  \r\nBefore the defendantâ€™s trial date (July 30, 2018), Ranger Martin over multiple days met and worked with the District Attorney.  Ranger Martin contacted other officers / detectives from Charlotte, Davidson County, High Point, and Guilford County and drove many miles to obtain incident reports involving Mr. Brady from other agencies to assist the DA with prosecuting the case.   Ranger Martin was instrumental in getting many of the victims to come to court and testify regarding their activity at the park and to the loss and damage to their property.  Ranger Martin also provided substantial testimony for the prosecution and for the defense during Mr. Bradyâ€™s trial.  On the fourth day of the trial, the Superior Court judge dismissed the case due to the stateâ€™s failure of being able to positively identify Mr. Brady as the person doing the break-ins.  Afterward the judge praised Ranger martin for his work and professionalism.\r\nEven though the case was lost, it was a huge case for the JORD ranger staff where as many as five rangers provided testimony for a substantial felony case in Superior Court.  Ranger Martin could have easily just taken a report and gone about his daily duties, but he didnâ€™t.   Instead he went the extra mile to protect park visitors and seek justice for the victims that visited Jordan Lake.\r\n','fred.watkins@ncparks.gov','919-362-0586','','JORD','SODI','PIRE','2018-08-07','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','No','','','Yes','','0000-00-00','','Watkins1245,Watkins1245,Watkins1245,Greenwood3841,Gallagher9613,Tillotson5212,Fischer9767,Greenwood3841,Shea4229,Higgins6125,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841','','','','',''),(130,'AN_130','2018','Award Granted','4','3 JORD staff - see below','Nomination for staff: Rangers Emily Davies, Erin Brown, and Derek Parsons.\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 2018 at approximately 11am; 911 dispatcher informed Ranger Davies that a female had doused herself in a gasoline and had a lighter with the intent of committing suicide.  Rangers Davies, Brown, and a deputy initially responded to site A47 in Crosswinds Campground.  They found a female (5\'8\" - 300 lbs) that was extremely agitated after having an argument with her wife and seeing the police.  It was also discovered the woman was bipolar and hadn\'t taken her prescribed medication for two months  Rangers Davies, Brown and the deputy began to talk with the female to see if she was OK, ascertain her mental status, and to deescalate the situation.  At this time ranger Parsons arrived and staged at a nearby restroom building.  After several minutes, they decided their presence wasn\'t helping the agitated female and decided to give the female some time and space to \"cool down\". Rangers Davies and Brown stayed in the area and several minutes later observed the woman walk down to the lake\'s shoreline.  They followed her and made another attempt to talk with her.  It was at this point the woman waded out into the lake, sat down, and began submerging her head in an attempt to drown herself.  Rangers Davies and Brown went after her and tried to pull her back to shore.  The female then laid down in the water, told them she wanted to die, and continued to submerge her head.  Davies and Brown fought to keep her head above water and called for assistance.  Ranger Parsons responded and waded in to help.  Finally, after several minutes and with the help of two deputies, rangers were able to place handcuffs on the female and drag her back to shore.  Later, the woman was taken to UNC hospital under an involuntary commitment order.  Full report can be found - OCA# 18-01086.\r\n\r\nI think theses rangers went above and beyond by risking their personal safety to prevent a woman from committing suicide.

At that moment I remembered a conversation I had with Ranger Fambrough a few weeks prior about the possibility of a couple leading a full moon hike at the park.   Little did I know, Dave and Heidiâ€™s dedication to public service would allow them to become one of the biggest supporters of Medoc Mountain State Park.  \r\n\r\nDave and Heidi own Lake Gaston Outfitters, which is a retail sporting goods store on Lake Gaston located about 25 minutes from the park.  In their day to day operations they meet many folks who are looking for recreational opportunities in the area, so they are quick to recommend a visit to the park.  In addition to recommendations, they arrange opportunities for groups of people to â€œmeet-upâ€ and explore the outdoors through paddling, hiking, and biking.  They manage all aspects of the â€œmeet-upsâ€ from organizing a location, advertising, signing people up, and leading the activities.  Since January 2017, Heidi has had great success offering and leading a full moon hike every month, when the weather cooperated.  Her commitment to the park and her community has not gone unnoticed as she chooses to put her personal life on hold and come to the park with a group of strangers to lead a hike through the woods at night.  There is no doubt that the people who participate in her hike gain a whole new appreciation for the park and the environment.  \r\n\r\nHeidiâ€™s dedication alone would be something to brag about, but her husband, Dave, has gotten in on the fun as well.  Dave has been a major supporter of the park in his own way.  When Dave learned about the new mountain bike trails that were being built in early 2017 he was eager to assist with their development in any way possible.  Once the mountain bike trails were completed, and before they were opened to the public, Dave got a chance to ride the trails as a â€œsneak peekâ€ so that he could give an honest opinion of the trail system and offer suggestions about what should be altered before they were opened.  Dave was there when we cut the ribbon and officially opened the bike trails and since then, he has organized trail ride â€œmeet-upsâ€ multiple times per month, both on weekends and during the week.  The trail rides have been so widely popular that visitors often travel 90 minutes to ride along with Dave.  \r\n\r\nDave has also taken a lead role in the Friends of Medoc organization.  He has invested his own time and money promoting the group and soliciting members.  He assisted with redefining the mission of the Friendâ€™s Group to focus on public awareness, advocacy for conservation, and support of maintenance through organized trail work days.  He has volunteered to assist with large events at the park and, in events he was unable to attend, Dave would rummage up volunteers to assist at park.    No matter what the â€œeventâ€ is (trail races, Heritage Day Celebration, prescribed burning, etc.) Dave will also be there willing to assist in any way possible.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not all of Dave and Heidiâ€™s volunteer hours have been recorded on paper or in a database, but in the past two years I feel very confident that they have surpassed a combined 400 hours of volunteer services at the park.  Even when they are not at the park, Dave and Heidiâ€™s recommendations about the park are having an impact on the number of people who visit the park.  Through general conversations with visitors, it is becoming more common to hear, \"Dave or Heidi recommended the park to usâ€ which then opens the door for public awareness of activities at the park.  \r\n\r\nThere is no telling what future opportunities Dave and Heidi will offer the public which will utilize the park, but as time goes on one thing will be for certain:  Dave and Heidi will always support the park because they value itâ€™s worth in the community, believe in its mission of management, and care about its existence.  That is why I wish to nominate Dave and Heidi Blodgett for the Divisionâ€™s Locke Craig Award.\r\n\r\nDave and Heidi Blodgett\r\n2457 Eaton Ferry Road \r\nLittleton, NC \r\n27850\r\n252-586-1770\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lakegastonoutfitters.com/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FriendsOfMedocMountainStatePark/\r\n','joel.jakubowski@ncparks.gov','252-586-6588','','MEMO','','PIRE','2018-11-01','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','0000-00-00','','Jakubowski8022,Gallagher9613,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Fischer9767,Greenwood3841,Shea4229,Hall2942,Higgins6125,Greenwood3841','','','uploads/2018/AN_131_other_file_1_8527.jpg','',''),(132,'AN_132','2018','Award Granted','5','Ian Magill','On June 26th, 2018, at around 1100 hours, Ranger Ian Magill, responded to radio report that a child was having a severe allergic reaction. This occurred at the vicinity of the Jacob Fork Parking Area.Rangers Leigh Ann Angle and Carlo Deangelus were also on scene. Ranger Angle took information from the patient\'s family. Due to nonexistent cell phone service and poor radio communications, in this area, Ranger Magill instructed Ranger Deangelus to use the maintenance building landline to call Burke County EMS.     \r\n\r\nFrom his EMS training, Ranger Magill was able to deduce that the child had symptoms of Anaphylaxis. (A swelling of the airway that can lead to possible death) \r\nRanger Magill administered the medication Epinephrine. The medication alleviated the swollen airways and the child\'s appearance began to improve to the point where Anaphlyaxic symptoms were no longer visibly observed.   \r\n\r\nFor approximately 15 minutes, Ranger Magill was the primary care giver for this child. At around 1120 hours, the First Responders from South Mountains Fire and Rescue arrived on scene. It was not until around 1140 hours, that Burke Country Advanced Life Support arrived on scene. It is quite probable to believe without Ranger Magill\'s interventions, that this child\'s condition could have worsened from a possible life threatening situation to a possible death.

For this park to thrive, we rely on driven, hard-working rangers like Steve McMurray. I\'ve worked here for less than two years compared to Steve\'s 10+ and where I\'ve watched some people become worn down by the challenges of working at a reservoir, Steve seems to thrive on the activity. People have joked about how much time he spends on equipment or cleaning fire rings in Poplar Point because he is always working hard on some project to make his area (the largest campground at JORD) as nice as possible for visitors. Steve goes above and beyond to use his passions to make his assigned area a better place, such as his woodworking talent to build organizers for camping tags, receipts and a laptop stand inside of his ticket booth, and a firewood lockbox for outside the booth. He always maintains a sense of humor with his coworkers and a professional knowledge of park ecology which he shares with visitors through programs and roving interpretation. His dedication to EE is what particularly makes him deserving of an award. In a place like JORD with constant projects going on, EE can often go on the backburner. However, when any ranger has a question about EE, species identification, I&E program resources, eagles, or past/current I&E contacts, people go to Steve. I\'m sure anyone who has worked longer alongside Steve could say more but after so many years of hard work and service, I think he deserves to be recognized for what he brings to NC State Parks.

He has the ability to foresee problems that will arise, fix things that were previously deemed \"unfixable,\" and come up with creative solutions to problems that the park is having. Thomas is the first person that anybody calls when something is broken or damaged. He routinely comes in early and stays late to get the job done. \r\nPrior to Hurricane Florence, Thomas was my right hand man, helping me prepare and organize tasks that needed to be completed, keeping staff motivated to get the job done, and making sure that the park was as prepared as possible for the impending storm. As staff began evacuating, Thomas stayed behind, ensuring that all tasks were completed. He was the last person to leave the park before the storm and the first person to return after the storm. \r\nSince almost all of the staff of Hammocks Beach evacuated, including myself, there were very few employees to make an initial assessment after the storm had passed. Even with damage to his own home, Thomas returned to the park for an assessment, ensuring buildings were not leaking and mitigating any immediate issues. Thomas was a true leader in the initial days of clean-up. I was unable to return for several days as roads into the county were flooded. Thomas led the staff as they began returning to work. He kept in constant contact with me about the status of the park and staff. He made sure that employees had food and water and coordinated getting meals for lunches (there was no power at the park for 8 days). He conducted morning safety briefings, made sure FEMA forms were filled out, hours were tracked on equipment, and that everybody was working as a team to complete daily missions. He kept in contact with RESU Fullwood and coordinated getting needed equipment from other parks, even delivering a tractor to Fort Macon after hours when they needed it to pump water out of the fort. \r\nWhen I was able to return, I was blown away not only by the amount of damage the area sustained, but by how much work had already been accomplished by the staff. Without Thomas\'s leadership before, during and after the hurricane, the outcome would have been drastically different. He should be commended for his hard work and dedication.

He made dozens of calls across the world to New Zealand to arrange a discounted bulk order price so that FSP funds would go further.  He made calls and in-person visits to promote the program with park superintendents and local friends groups.

Only 150 entries are accepted each year and there are typically over 180 applications.  The parade is the largest parade between Atlanta and Washington DC. Over 250,000 people watch the parade live from home and over 60,000 attend the parade in person.\r\n\r\nTo make this happen, Jessica had to get support from and organize park staff and division management, seek funding for the project from Friends of State Parks, and submit an application including a drawing of the float design and a description of the float.  This required a tremendous amount of work that took place before even knowing if the application would be accepted in the parade.\r\n\r\nSheila Brown took Jessica\'s ideas on a theme for the float and turned those ideas into a design and drawing to be submitted with the application.  According to Jessica, when she asked me to nominate Sheila for an award:  \r\n\r\n\"The only reason this parade float is going to happen is because of her.  She made some lofty idea of mine into reality and is the creative director of this float- which for me means she is the lead.  I am just following directions and contacting people.  The float is going to look amazing and we will look amazing because of her.\"  \r\n\r\nJessica also let me know that our application would not have been approved without Sheila\'s drawing.  The majority of the other floats in the parade are constructed by a professional float company and groups just show up and ride the floats.  NC State Parks float was one of the only hand-made floats and there were many comments overheard that it was the best and most elaborate float in the parade.\r\n\r\nOnce the application was accepted, Sheila and Jessica both spent large amounts of time, much of it outside of work, going to places to secure up-cycled materials such as the scrap exchange for materials.  Everything on the float was hand-made by Sheila and Jessica (all the paper mache sea animals, seaweed, and other decorations) with help from other park staff to assemble the float.  \r\n\r\nJessica even arranged to have a live band playing original music on the float.  The band contained four current park employees and one retired park employee playing guitars, drums, kazoos, and singing on an amplified speaker system so everyone watching the parade could hear.  To my knowledge, this was the only float in the parade with live music and definitely the only float with songs such as  \"I\'m a Ranger in The Park\", and \"Dirt, Dirt, Dirt\".\r\n\r\nThis float was loved by everyone who saw it in the crowd and generated a tremendous amount of exposure for NC State Parks.  It also provided an excellent opportunity for park staff to come together for a fun time.  Everyone pitched in to build and transport the float.  Park staff also dressed in costumes and brought family members also dressed in costume.  It was a great morale and bonding experience.\r\n\r\nI can\'t even begin to figure out how to add up the amount of time that went in to this project, but it was significant.  I could not believe the finished product when I saw it and was extremely proud to be driving this creation, full of my family and friends, through the streets of Raleigh.  The float was awesome, the band sounded great, and I saw smiles and excitement on thousands of people.\r\n\r\n ','scott.letchworth@ncparks.gov','919-571-4170','','WIUM','NODI','PIRE','2018-11-19','','','','','','','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Letchworth5004','','','uploads/2018/AN_149_other_file_1_9702.docx','',''),(150,'AN_150','2018','','2','Jacob Arthur','Performing substantially beyond expectations.\r\n\r\nAs the Maintenance Mechanic IV at WIUM, Jacob Arthur is responsible for leading the maintenance program at the park and the supervision of the maintenance staff.  In March 2017, Jake was promoted from Maintenance Mechanic II to Maintenance Mechanic IV.  Once receiving the promotion, Jake set about quietly and efficiently reorganizing the entire maintenance operation in the park.  \r\n\r\nJake came into a difficult set of circumstances when he took over the maintenance department.  Prior years of budget crisis had resulted in the loss of a full time maintenance position for the park, leaving a smaller group of 4 employees who had more tasks than could be kept up with.  Hiring freezes during those years had also led to 2-3 positions remaining vacant for over 12 months.  There had also been previous personnel issues that resulted in a termination and other staff becoming disgruntled and not working efficiently.  All of these circumstances presented Jake with a very disorganized environment.  For the past couple of years prior to his promotion, maintenance staff had been going from one maintenance emergency to the next with no time to catch up.  All of the shop building were terribly disorganized, some filled with clutter from projects so full you could barely cut a path across the room, there was little cohesion in the staff, and actually, very little staff.  Jacob only had one other employee working when he became maintenance mechanic IV and had to first hire two vacant positions.\r\n\r\nIn a year and a half, Jake has completely reorganized the maintenance staff and program at William B. Umstead State Park. He has developed staff procedures for all their tasks, implemented safety initiatives, brought organization and efficiency where there was previously chaos and disorder, and has strengthened working relatio9nships.  Most importantly, he has created a team of maintenance professionals who are motivated, proud of what they do, and work together unlike any group I have worked with.  \r\n\r\nOur maintenance staff is now organized and efficient.  All of the shop buildings are clean and efficient work places.  OSHA regulations are receiving top priority and voluntary compliance from all staff members.  Maintenance now holds weekly organization meetings and communication among staff members is exemplary.  Maintenance has caught up with and completed projects that have languished for years and now has time to begin working on improvements instead of just making repairs.\r\n\r\nNone of this was easy to achieve.  It took a tremendous amount of hard work.  Jake could have easily come into this position and done much less.  On his own, without needing to be asked or assigned to do this, he has made improvements that will benefit the park for years to come.

Leading a project to rebuild the entire interior of the maintenance office including insulating previously un-insulated walls, taking out fake pine paneling and dry-walling new walls, new floor, ceiling work, remodeling bathroom including tearing out of interior wall and rebuilding, new led lights in the ceiling, and repainting of the entire building.  The building is now clean and energy efficient and looks like a brand new office.\r\n\r\n2.  Leading and organizing shop improvements that include removing 50 years of accumulated junk,identifying old items for surplus, tearing out all old cabinets and shelves and rebuilding new more efficient work bench and counter space, working with an electrician to rewire significant portions of the shop, installing led ceiling lighting, painting all of the grey cinder block walls white, installing ceiling insulation, worked with a local running group who wanted to make donations to the park to purchase a new high -end safety table saw, and install a dust collection system on all wood working tools. \r\n\r\n3.  Created a database to track vehicle repairs and service, equipment repairs and service, and tool and equipment purchase records.  Jason can now look up any piece of equipment in the park and know when it was last serviced, what services or repairs were performed, the total cost of repairs and any other information such as fuel or oil type.\r\n\r\n4.  Jason has created a check-out system for equipment that is being used and kept up with which gives information on who has what equipment, where it is incase someone else needs it, and what it was last used for which helps in identifying what may need to be fixed when it is turned in to the shop for unknown repairs.\r\n\r\n5.  Jason has implemented safety improvements including a new/correct lock-out/tag out system, employee training on each piece of equipment and a database to track the training, proper OSHA signage and safety equipment for the shops, and repair and service manuals for all equipment.\r\n\r\nThere are also dozens of little things Jason has done such as getting the correct tools for repairs where previously the wrong tool was modified to do something which doesn\'t really work.  Purchasing and using new shelving and organization systems for parts and materials, conducting safety meetings on the safe use and also the maintenance and care of equipment.\r\n\r\nHis contributions have led to a profession, organized, accountable, and much safer maintenance area and program.

Steven reported that it is the most complained about section and was an eyesore and safety hazard due to the amount of illegal dumping.\r\n \r\nMy daughter Brooke is a member of the Sauratown Trailblazers 4H Horse and Pony Club. (Not affiliated with STA). The club was asking if there was a community service project they could do to benefit the park and I told them there was a section of trail in need of cleaning and several other projects. They chose the clean up project and chose a date. \r\n\r\nDue to there being couches, tires, tvs, mattresses, and other large debris that was heavy, I shared the work date with Steven and STA. Steven said he would ask for STA volunteers to join us to do the heavy lifting. This was now going to be a joint community service project between HARO park staff, STA, and the Sauratown Trailblazers 4H. \r\n\r\n On March 16, 2019 eleven 4H girls and five parents joined me at Thore Road to pick up the litter. We were soon joined by thirteen adult members of STA. We spent six hours cleaning about two miles of littered roadside. The day was amazing. We bagged loose trash and stacked debris for pick up.

As he got closer, Ranger Sicard told the individual that he was not allowed to  stand on the viaduct and that he needed to leave. The individual responded with â€œI donâ€™t care about your rules I am going to jump off here.â€  Ranger Sicard quickly began a conversation to distract the individual from looking over the edge of the viaduct and to focus on him. After a couple minutes of talking with him, Ranger Sicard was able to get the individual away from the edge and buckled into the passenger seat of his patrol vehicle. At first, he was extremely agitated and was yelling, saying how stupid he was and he should have just jumped right then, and as Ranger Sicard turned into the Wilson Creek Overlook to turn around, the individual opened the door wanting to get out of the vehicle, but Ranger Sicard took his seatbelt in his hand pulled so that it was difficult for him to exit. Ranger Sicard told him to close the door and to talk with him about what he had going on that was making him want to do this. At that point he mellowed out and became conversational. When Ranger Sicard got to the Viaduct Visitor Center, he was able to call the Parkway Dispatch and request to have a National Parks Service (NPS) Ranger meet him there since it was NPS Jurisdiction.  Until three NPS rangers arrived at 5:15pm, Ranger Sicard continued to talk with the individual and upon his request, Ranger Sicard contacted several of his family members to let them know he was safe and that he wanted to be voluntarily committed to the hospital for help. Given the choice of riding to the hospital with an NPS Ranger or Ranger Sicard, the individual pointed to Ranger Sicard and said, â€œwith Andyâ€.  The rangers arrived at Cannon Hospital and began the comitial process, spoke with the Psychiatric Doctor, gave their statements, transported the individualâ€™s personal vehicle from the Visitor Center parking lot to Cannonâ€™s parking lot and were clear of the scene at approximately 8:15pm. Ranger Sicard was in an area with limited cell and radio service and he knew that he was going to have to handle this alone.

Lifeguards Brenna Tromble, Maria Turner, and Morgan Flynt were cleaning, locking up, and preparing to go home when they heard screaming near the fishing pier, which is about 450\' from the beach, not within site of the beach. They sprinted over and began searching the water with two bystanders (John Scott and unidentified female) where a woman was screaming her husband had gone under. Ranger Anthony quickly called dispatch for medical responders and began getting information from the hysterical woman and asking her to pinpoint the location. Visibility in the water was poor and the water is 9 feet deep. The lifeguards and bystander eventually located the man and pulled him to shore where he was pulled onto land with assistance by fire department and EMS personnel who had arrived. Ranger Anthony began performing CPR compressions while paramedics began suctioning water and placing a defibrillator. Ranger Anthony and two Danbury fire department volunteers (Logan Whitaker and Jacob Bullins) took turns doing compressions. Paramedics installed a LUCAS device which gives mechanical compressions. They loaded him into the ambulance for advanced care and later transportation to WFU Baptist hospital. During this incident refreshment stand employees Elisabeth East and Isabelle Marshall tried to comfort and console the victim\'s wife and four small children who were in a frenzied emotional state during rescue efforts. rnrnThe lifeguards deserve recognition for their attempt to save a life using the lifeguard training and skills they possessed, but it should be noted that they are all under the age of 21 and the drowning occurred after their shift had ended and in an area not used for swimming. They were doing lifesaving efforts in an unfamiliar part of the lake. They persistently kept diving until they located the man. Ranger Anthony was attempting to save a life using CPR skills and training he possessed but it should be noted that after the incident he drove the victim\'s family home and spent considerable time afterward in the following weeks communicating with the family and went above and beyond the scope of his duties to comfort them. Refreshment stand employees Elisabeth East and Isabelle Marshall (also under the age of 21) were untrained for any of this and went wildly above and beyond what is expected of them to provide the utmost highest level of customer service during a tragedy. The entire shift of volunteer fire fighters, paramedics, and fire marshals who responded (if you need all their names I will get it to you) performed their tasks as they have been trained but it should be noted that they also helped maintain order in the park, provided chaplains to everyone involved on site, assisted rangers with scene documentation, and assisted with getting the victim\'s family home, which is all beyond the scope of what is expected of them. rnAnother point which should be mentioned is that Ranger Anthony returned to the park and closed cash registers and the gates that night. This job is absurd. There are no police officers who come back in and finish a shift after performing CPR.

NCHPTA is an active group that promotes stewardship of the natural resources of the surrounding Black Mountain region through outdoor recreation, education and volunteer opportunities. They do this through a busy schedule of hikes, trail construction and maintenance, litter clean-ups, improving outdoor recreation opportunities and flora and fauna education for children through adult ages.\r\nIn the past 11 months, NCHPTA has been an integral component to pushing the park in a progressive direction during periods of extreme staff shortage. Due to these shortages, MOMI staff has struggled to keep up with educational programming requests. NCHPTA has stepped up and represented MOMI in several educational programs throughout the past year, supporting their mission statement, and the educational component of the NC State Parkâ€™s mission statement.\r\nEven beyond traditional environmental education, the NCHPTA strives to relay park information to park visitors through a webcam/weather station. MOMI can be very difficult to visit in the harsh winter months. But this doesnâ€™t keep park visitors from seeing the current conditions through a live webcam which incorporates a live weather station. Since the weather changes so drastically between local weather stations and the park, their live weather conditions help prepare the park visitors which improves visitor safety. The weather station/webcam is one of NC State Parkâ€™s only friends group run stations and can be directly attributed to visitor safety and education. This information can be found on the NCHPTA website as well as two monitors within the park; one at the gift shop/concession stand area and one at the park office. All the equipment and maintenance are supported completely through the NCHPTA and their members who actively meet with park staff to make updates when needed. \r\nSomething that continues to differentiate NCHPTA from other Friends groups is their work on NC State Parkâ€™s Travelers Information Station. Members of the group have met with me at least every month to plan and research a radio antenna and information station to relay pertinent park information for the parkâ€™s visitors via radio. The current status of the information station revolves around delays that have come through the State Construction Office. All of the hardware has been purchased. Alan Orvitz, one of their members has worked to acquire refurbished antennae and hardware components which have saved the friends group several thousand dollars off of the initial quote. NCHPTA has hired an engineer to work with the SCOâ€™s engineer concerns of the antennae tower and we are currently waiting for a quote for the entire antenna installation. Without the contractorâ€™s help, NCHPTA plans to install the entire antennae using their group for labor. The ongoing permitting process for this antenna has included hours researching hardware, applying for FCC permits, SCO permits and work with the PASU in PRAF submission. Meetings revolving around the information station and antenna tower have been weekly during the permitting process for the SCO. NCHPTA reports 36 volunteer hours for this project, but Alan has worked many more unrecorded hours on this project.\r\nProviding the best recreational experience for MOMI visitors, NCHPTA has trail days which encourage volunteers to assist in trail maintenance. Something that like education, has been neglected through MOMI staff vacancies. NCHPTA has recorded 156 volunteer hours of trail work within the park. What separates the group from other friends groups, is their willingness to work in winter weather conditions that are routinely below freezing and during snowy conditions. Conditions that would cancel other group workdays, drive the NC High Peaks Trail Association volunteer efforts. Besides hands-on trail work and maintenance, NCHPTA has submitted, and been awarded RTP grants and used this money to hire the Army Corp ACE Group to complete trail work in the past several years. This year, ACE worked for four weeklong sessions to improve the Mount Mitchell Trail leading to the Black Mountain Campground from the summit trail near the summit tower, all the way down to the MOMI/USFS boundary; approximately 1.5 miles in length. In both cases, the NCHPTA has been responsible for several miles of trail work that would not have been completed without their efforts. \r\nThe above examples, and the continued service to Mount Mitchell State Park, North Carolina State Parks and our visitors is why I am nominating the North Carolina High Peaks Trail Association for the Locke Craig Award. They have routinely exceeded my expectations in their representation of NC State Parks and Mount Mitchell. Because of their work for the park and the leadership of their president, John Whitehouse, the visitors and park staff of Mount Mitchell State Park have experiences that align with our Divisionâ€™s mission statement to promote safe, educational and stewardship driven recreational opportunities. \r\n','kevin.bischof@ncparks.gov','828-675-4611','','MOMI','WEDI','MORE','2019-10-01','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','Yes','0000-00-00','','Bischof1026,Bischof1026,Greenwood3841,Gallagher9613,Shea4229,Blanchard3795,Greenwood3841,Hall2942,Hall2942,Hall2942,Fischer9767,Hall2942','','','uploads/2019/AN_163_other_file_1_9038.jpg','',''),(164,'AN_164','2019','Nomination Received by Awards Committee','3','NC High Peaks Trail Association','NC High Peaks Trail Association DBA Friends of Mount Mitchell. \r\nPresident John Whitehouse Tel: 828-682-3217\r\nhttps://nchighpeaks.org/about\r\n\r\nNC High Peaks must be the hardest working Friends Group in the State.

In addition to the 3, 647 acres of GRMO proper, the four full time ranger staff and one full time maintenance mechanic are currently managing and protecting 4,432 acres across five state natural areas. These areas host some of the most significant and rare natural community types in the Southern Appalachians; which provide critical habitat for a multitude of endemic as well as threatened and endangered species. The park staff have committed to carving out time amongst all other operational demands to manage these landscapes. With a precedent set by ELKN at the PIBO properties, GRMO has continued monthly bog workdays and a full week with BRIDGE crew assistance at the beginning and end of each growing season to battle hardwood and invasive species encroachment.  Not only are these workdays set aside at the beginning of the calendar year, but all full time and seasonal staff working on those dates set aside all other projects to dedicate their shift to resource management work.  Because of the staff prioritizing these workdays, we have seen significant restorative changes in hydrology, reduction in inappropriate hardwood and invasive species, and the re-emergence of imperiled and/or listed Southern Appalachian bog species.\r\n	In addition to their bog work, staff have actively pursued charges on multiple occurrences of poaching on their natural areas. In addition to partnering with local WRC Officers and County Sheriffâ€™s Deputies to pursue game hunters on protected lands, park staff have broadened their reach to protect non-game species as well. Staff have partnered with Plant Conservation Program members to better learn general statutes that apply to important plant species that often fall through the cracks. They have repeatedly marked ginseng populations with silicone dye to discourage poachers and aid in their prosecution. Staff have shared their dye and skills with other rangers to help spread this work to other mountain parks. Staff have also cultivated relationships with County District Attorneys to help prioritize natural resource protection charges that can often be overlooked.\r\n	And finally, GRMO staff have partnered with numerous Federal, State, and Conservancy partners on the greater Roan Mountain landscape to protect this unique area from the detrimental impacts of feral hogs. For several years, GRMO has actively participated in the USDA APHIS program to remove hogs from these imperiled communities. Staff have dedicated time, money, and park resources to aid in the tracking and removal of hogs in these remote areas. Because of this program, we are seeing a reduction in detrimental impact from this invasive species. Without the high level of commitment from all the staff at GRMO, we would not be able to accomplish such successes in managing and protecting the resources in these significant landscapes.\r\n','jon.blanchard@ncparks.gov','9197079307','','GRMO','','MORE','2019-10-07','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Blanchard3795,Blanchard3795,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Hall2942,Hall2942,Fischer9767,Hall2942,Hall2942,Shea4229','','','','',''),(166,'AN_166','2019','','1','Paul Branch','We were at fall firearms the other day.

The White Rock Ridge trail investigation and criminal case was his lead â€“ the results of which led to the successful petition for the area-wide natural resource closure and likely a conviction on 46 charges to include restitution.

Their combined hard work, knowledge and skill have saved the park and Division hundreds of thousands of dollars in contract fees for trail projects. With over 47 miles of marked and maintained trails, SOMO staff are responsible for quite a bit of trail maintenance, particularly on heavily travelled foot trails. High Shoals Falls Loop is hiked by thousands of park visitors each week. Much of this trail was initially constructed in the 1980\'s and 1990\'s by the Youth Conservation Corps and park staff. Annual maintenance and repairs to infrastructure such as steps and bridges are necessary to ensure visitor safety and resource protection. While many steps and bridges have been replaced over the years, the recent teamwork of LeighAnn, Mark and Fitz has resulted in a grand and sweeping, eye-catching, durable, natural rock staircase to replace an old, narrow, steep and constricting wooden staircase that has been a troublesome bottleneck for park visitors and a challenge for emergency medical responders carrying patients for decades. Rangers LeighAnn and Mark, who serve as the park\'s lead trail staff, first thought of replacing the old wooden staircase months ago after yet another annual trail assessment led them to discuss the need to replace the staircase before it became a safety hazard. Over the last couple years, LeighAnn and Mark have been steadily replacing old wooden structures with natural rock in multiple places along High Shoals Falls Loop. This steep staircase, with a full flight of steps, has been their greatest undertaking. Mark spent hours assessing the slope and terrain surrounding the staircase to determine the feasibility and ensure adequate resource protection. They pitched their idea to the park superintendent and other park staff, and received support from everyone. With their combined knowledge, training and years of experience in rockwork and trail design and construction, they were perfectly suited for the task, saving the park and the Division hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracting fees and headaches. They coordinated with park staff to remove hazard trees and prepare the site in advance. They coordinated with a local quarry to obtain large slabs of native rock measuring to their specifications. With the heavy equipment expertise of MCT Fitz, LeighAnn and Mark worked with other park staff and volunteers to construct an absolutely impressive rock staircase with a minimum 4\' width that more easily accommodates high visitor traffic and allows for safer carry-outs in EMS incidents requiring staff to carry a patient in a stokes basket (which happens fairly regularly). MCT Fitz is a very skilled excavator operator and was able to place each rock individually with LeighAnn and Mark\'s direction and assistance with hand tools. Each of 30+ rocks had to be carefully placed and levelled, per sustainability guidelines. They carefully removed the old wooden staircase and rehabbed the area. The approach to the top of the new rock staircase was also reworked to improve equipment access and future emergency response.rn As their immediate supervisor, I worked alongside LeighAnn and Mark over the course of the eight weeks it took from prep to final placement. I witnessed their dedication to complete the project in as little time as possible, only being hampered by materials availability and the ever-constant stream of park visitors using the trail. They worked safely to minimize visitor inconvenience. The trail remained open 95% of the time, only closing immediately during heavy equipment operation or when other hazards presented. All three worked in unison, communicating well and never compromising on safety. There were challenges, but through pop-up rain showers, mini-mudslides and wind, they persevered. They even carefully sourced native rocks to finish the job. Every visitor that I witnessed passing them was greeted, and the visitors took a moment to appreciate the work and thank them for their hard work and effort to build the rock steps. Humans and dogs alike have already trampled up and down those stairs with big smiles and tails wagging. See attached picture of work in progress.

Immediately after receiving the text the Burke County EMS dispatcher called the park office to request that a ranger go to the Paddy\'s Creek shop to check on a patient who was just injected with Epinephrine after an insect sting. They stated that an ambulance was in route. I arrived at the maintenance shop approximately five minutes later and found the patient, Daniel Bumgarner, sitting in a chair just outside the front door. He was talking and smoking a cigarette. Mr. Bumgarner\'s face appeared slightly swollen and red. He also appeared to have hives and welts covering his exposed arms. \r\nChristopher Sigmon then reported to me that two construction workers from the Visitor Center project site brought Mr. Bumgarner to the shop because he had been stung by something on the inside of his right bicep and that he was unable to breathe. Sigmon also reported that Mr. Bumgarnerâ€™s entire head and face were swollen to the point that his eyes were swollen shut. Mr. Sigmon ran to the refrigerator and grabbed the park\'s Epinephrine kit, drew up 0.6 cc of Epinephrine, and administered .3 cc to the outside of Mr. Bumgarner\'s right arm. Sigmon reported that within one minute the swelling was subsiding and Mr. Bumgarner started talking. Sigmon immediately called 911. The paramedics arrived nearly 30 minutes later. They examined Mr. Bumgarner and recommended he go directly to a hospital. Mr. Bumgarner refused transport by EMS, but had a co-worker take him where he was treated further and later released. \r\n\r\nIf it were not for Christopher Sigmon jumping into action and immediately administering epinephrine, Mr. Bumgarner would likely not have survived the 30 minutes it took for the paramedics to arrive, as he was already unable to breath. Sigmon was trained in administering epinephrine and received a refresher training just a few weeks prior to this incident. This is a testament to the importance of having several trained professionals at every state park and to the bravery and professionalism of Chris Sigmon to act as he was trained to on that day. \r\n','nora.coffey@ncparks.gov','8285847728','','LAJA','WEDI','MORE','2021-09-15','','','','','','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Coffey9695,Coffey9695,Tillotson5212','','','','',''),(173,'AN_173','2021','','2','Angelia Allcox','As you are all aware, the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing team for NC State Parks has been helping our employees to deal with stress and anxiety and come to terms with some very difficult situations for many years.

In a time when everyoneâ€™s plates are overloaded, the LAJA maintenance staff has voluntarily picked up the torch on fire and stepped up on invasive treatment efforts, all while juggling the usual busted water lines, failing septic systems, trail projects, major maintenance projects, and the like. The staff recognized a need in their park and voluntarily stepped up to help fill the gap; but they didnâ€™t stop there, for years now, they have gone above and beyond. They maintain fire lines better than most, have installed new lines requested through a combination of in-house and BRIDGE coordination, send several maintenance staff to work on unpleasant and substantial invasive treatment efforts multiple days a year, keep the slip-ons for fire & the spray rigs for invasives consistently up and running as well as ensuring that projects with this equipment get completed.  Theyâ€™ve consistently looped NR staff in on issues w/ water quality, erosion, and stabilization for construction & trails projects.  They assist w/ Rx fires at their own and numerous regional parks and are willing to drop everything on short notice to get â€œday ofâ€ fire line prep handled so Rx burns can happen at LAJA. The LAJA Maint staff also run local lead on maintaining and coordinating the effective use of multiple Regional equipment including the WEDI â€œNRâ€ skid-steer mulcher and dozer.\r\n\r\nWith the support of PASU, Nora Coffey, Maint. Supervisor Chris Sigmon, fosters this work ethic and sense of teamwork in his staff and he himself has contributed to multiple NR trainings such as S-212 and assisted with trainee oversight on the fire line for multiple NWCG positions over the years. The NR efforts at LAJA and across the Mtn Region are consistently able to progress forward due to the dedication and hard work of the LAJA Maintenance staff; Chris Sigmon, Drew Carswell, Keith Harris, Justin Allen, and Gabby Washington.  \r\n','jon.blanchard@ncparks.gov','919 707 9307','','LAJA','WEDI','MORE','2021-09-20','','','','','','No','','','','','Yes','0000-00-00','','Blanchard3795,Tillotson5212','','','','',''),(182,'AN_182','2021','','3','Andrea Kiser','Ms. Andrea Kiser reached out to Lake James State Park last October about having several large trees removed from Obeth Cemetery, a cemetery the state park inherited when it purchased the Burke County property in 2005. Obeth was the final resting place for several Revolutionary War soldiers and has been taken over by dozens of large trees, mostly pine, over the last century. In just under a year Andrea has raised over $15,000 and paid for more than 25 trees to be cut and removed from Obeth Cemetery. On top of that she has personally volunteered 196 hours of physical labor in the cemetery, moving and replacing headstones during the tree removal, repairing and cleaning headstones that were damaged or buried over the years, moving brush, and overseeing the tree removal process. She has recruited many other volunteers to help her with this work, but no one has dedicated the amount of time that Andrea has. It\'s truly remarkable what she has been able to accomplish in just under a year. The park is grateful for her hard work and dedication. \r\n\r\nHere is an excerpt of a letter Andrea shared explaining her work at Obeth:\r\n\r\nObeth Cemetery has been important to me since I was there with my dear grandmother in the 1950s.  I remember going into the small white church with windowpanes out, leaves on the floor and an old dusty organ on the left side at the front.\r\nGrandmotherâ€™s precious daughter, my aunt, that died at 20 years of age and her dear parents are buried there as well as many other family members. \r\n In past years, visiting the cemetery was not easy and you had to do so at your own peril, as the site stood within the boundaries of a hunting club.  It was the most wonderful news when my son Pat told me that it was now safely within the Paddyâ€™s Creek Area of Lake James State Park.  The joy it brought to be able to visit and know that it is safe â€¦ well, I have no words to describe it.  This sacred ground holds until Resurrection Day the remains of my four grandfathers and three grandmothers, as well as many other family members. \r\nA lot of the graves are in sad need of repair. There is a whole community of us, across the county and the U.S., with descendants buried here.  At age 80 and in the midst of the pandemic I decided to try and do something. Along with Susan Houck, Janie Matthews and some Daughters of the American Revolution ladies, we decided to do what we could to clean and straighten headstones and remove some of the small ground cover.  We want to preserve what is there and prevent further deterioration when possible.  \r\nWith the help of Edwin Norman, the location of the old church has been found and it is my dream to erect a permanent marker identifying it as the site so that it will not be lost to time.  \r\nIâ€™ve started a Facebook page called â€œLest We Forgetâ€¦..Obeth Remembered,â€ with around 50 people that have joined. We have had good response to our workdays.  I have had wonderful support from the park staff.  I am so thankful for all at Lake James State Park who are helping protect this cemetery.  These people lived and loved and had families.  They should not be forgotten. A favorite quote: No-one ever really dies until the last person forgets to remember them.  \r\n','nora.coffey@ncparks.gov','8285847728','','LAJA','WEDI','MORE','2021-09-22','','','','','','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Coffey9695,Coffey9695,Tillotson5212','','','','',''),(183,'AN_183','2021','','2','Christopher Fox','Chris joined the division in 1997 and in that very first year on, before even being commissioned, assisted in running that year\'s Fundamentals of Search and Rescue (FUNSAR) Training.  24 years later he is leading that program, organizing trainings, overseeing the Search and Rescue Counsel, and keeping the division trained to help search for and rescue people in need in North Carolina.\r\nThis is not a collateral duty of the position.

His achievements include modernizing the prescribed fire program, developing the exotic species crew, support of the bog working group, and restoration of thousands of acres of state park land. Jon has been an amazing spokesman for the Division and has raised the level of professionalism in one of the most important areas of our parksystem, stewardship of our amazing natural resources.  Jon is often called on by Department staff to work on high level committees such as the climate change initiative and the resiliency taskforce.  In addition, Jon is well know throughout the prescribed fire, natural heritage and exotic species management communities.  \r\nJon has been purposeful in focusing on the four pillars of natural resource management, fire, exotic species, rare species management and habitat restorations.  Jon\'s no nonsense approach and his focus on these four pillars of resource management has made the NC Division of Parks and Recreation a leader in the state in natural resource management.

Ranger Blake and Superintendent Trostle went above and beyond their normal responsibilities to ensure the safety and well being of a park visitor and employee during and after a medical emergency that occurred at Pettigrew State Park office.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, March 4, 2022, I Ranger Charlotte Davis had a family member have a medical emergency at the park office. Ranger Blake, Superintendent Trostle, and I quickly identified it as a suspected stroke. Ranger Blake and Superintendent Trostle communicated with EMS services to get them to the park office as quick as possible. Because of our teamwork, we were able to get my family member to the hospital quickly and get him a lifesaving reversal medication. Hospital staff has said that my family member was blessed, because most stroke patients do not make it to a hospital quick enough to give the reversal medicine.\r\n\r\nAs we were waiting for EMS to leave the park, Superintendent Trostle asked me what I was going to do about picking up my 4-year-old daughter from daycare. I can remember a million things going through my head, but not even thinking that far in advance. My nearest family member was 4 hours away. I told Superintendent Trostle â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€. Not even asking or hesitating, Superintendent Trostle said Iâ€™ll get her. Ranger Blake also took it upon himself to take care of my new puppy. Later that night, I was exhausted as I went to Superintendent Trostleâ€™s house to pick up my daughter. The sight I encountered brought a smile to my face. As I entered, I saw my daughter sitting at the kitchen table with a kitchen towel clipped around her neck, eating a big bowel of spaghetti, a smile on her face, and telling me all about getting to ride home with â€œJimmyâ€ and getting to play with his dog and cats. As we all know, not every boss would do this for an employee.\r\n\r\nIn all my years working for the State of North Carolina as well as working in the private sector, I have never encountered a boss that was such a shining example of what a leader should be. I have worked with Jim Trostle for approximately 4 Â½ years. In that time, I have encountered selflessness, a teacher, and a true leader. I consider Superintendent Trostle a boss and a friend, noâ€¦ Jim Trostle is family!!\r\n\r\nI have known Ranger Colton Blake for a little over 3 years. I call Ranger Blake â€œSuper Rangerâ€. He is a perfect example of what an all around park ranger should be. Knowledgeable in maintenance of boats, vehicles, construction, law enforcement, programming, and first aid; Ranger Blake has been a â€œgo toâ€ for work questions as well as personal questions; always willing to teach and help where ever he is needed. I consider Ranger Blake a family member as well.\r\n\r\nTo you, the acts of these two employees may be insignificant, but to me it meant the world.

We had ran out of room and one of our containers was rusting through and had to be replaced.\r\n\r\nWe planned on going through the same company we have always used but their prices skyrocketed.  Our Maintenance staff in passing mentioned this to Thomas Jones and he and David Parker got to work.  They were able to locate boxes at Federal Surplus and got us not one but three boxes for only $3,000.00.\r\n\r\nSo that was great but how would we get them?  No need to worry Thomas and David picked up all three boxes and placed and delivered each one of them for us at the park.  Not only that they picked up the old rusted box and transported it for us as well to surplus!\r\n\r\nFinally they had the skills and tools to deliver and haul away the old box.  Trust me it did not look easy but they had no problems!\r\n\r\nI can\'t put a dollar amount on this but its definitely thousands of dollars that they saved the division.

She noticed a car parked in the corner of the parking lot and as it was past time to lock the gate she approached to speak to the occupant. She immediately saw that the person had a head wound, was bleeding, and had a gun lying in their lap.  She quickly snatched the gun and secured it, grabbed her medical bag, called dispatch for assistance and started rendering medical care. Staib applied pressure to severe self-inflicted gunshot wounds that were on both sides of the patient\'s head. Ranger Staib gave critical care to the patient until EMS arrived. Staib then searched the park area for other victims or perpetrators and investigated the incident. Staib was able to remain composed during the duration and demonstrated extreme levels of calm and maturity. She seamlessly resorted to her training and experience during this crisis. She later used her detective skills to locate the patient\'s kin to inform them of their loved one\'s condition. During the night the patient succumbed to her injuries. Staib took great care and guts to speak to the patient\'s family and return the patient\'s belongings to the grieving family. I recommend her to get an award  because of the extreme nature of the incident but also for her excellent and calm handling from start to finish which is something you cannot be trained for.

The 24 hour event, starting at 4:00 p.m. included musical and educational programs in addition to the opening of the new NRC exhibits for the public of more than 70,000 visitors.  State Capitol Police and North Carolina state park staff assisted in the shared role of managing incident command/security for the event along with museum staff.  I, Karl Erik Nygard, NC State Parks, North District Superintendent, was stationed at the Incident Command Center and witnessed the immediate response unfold that resulted in the saving the life of a DENR contract employee. \r\n\r\nFrom Eno River State Park Superintendent Nealsonâ€™s report of the incident: \r\n\r\nOn April 20th, 2012 at approximately 16:20 hours (4:20 p.m.), I, Superintendent Keith Nealson, was on duty at the front desk of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences during the grand opening of the Nature Research Center (NRC).  Chief of Security Andrea Judd came running by, saying that she had an emergency somewhere in the building, a possible cardiac arrest.  She ran outside the building and I ran with her.  She encountered Officer Pender with State Capital Police and then the three of us ran back into the building and were joined by NC State Park Ranger Neal Ward.  Andrea had Officer Pender grab an AED and the four of us took the elevator to sub level B.  We proceeded to a maintenance area of that level where we found a NC Museum of Natural Sciences contract employee (name removed) unconscious and unresponsive on the ground.  A fellow employee was also there with the employee and he had witnessed the initial incident.  He stated that a few minutes earlier the contract employee had been leaning on a cart, had gotten shaky on his feet and had collapsed to the floor.  His eyes were open and he was attempting to breathe in short gasps every few seconds.  His face was beginning to turn cyanotic.  Ranger Ward and Officer Pender began a primary assessment.  His pulse was very weak and thready.\r\n\r\nAndrea Judd ran back up stairs to direct EMT personnel down.    I advised Officer Pender, State Capitol Police and Ranger Ward to remove the employee\'s shirt and undershirt.  I readied the AED.  Based on the fact that his breathing attempts were getting more and more sporadic and shallower it seemed likely that he was getting worse. \r\n\r\nWe attached the AED pads and the machine began to analyze the patient at about the same time that the employee appeared to stop breathing completely.  At this same time the first two EMTs from Wake County EMS showed up.  This was approximately 16:27 hours. (4:27 p.m.)   The AED advised to administer a shock to the employee, so Ranger Ward and I advised everyone to stand clear and I administered one shock.  One EMT began chest compressions.  The other EMT told Ranger Ward and I to operate a bag valve mask on the employee while she removed the pads from the AED we had used and put pads from her AED on the patient. \r\n\r\nRanger Ward and I operated the bag valve mask for the next several minutes while Wake County EMS did compressions.  Supplemental oxygen was added to the BVM by Wake County EMS.  During this time at least one more shock was administered and the employee again appeared to be trying to intake breathes at a very slow rate- about 2-3 breathes a minute.  After a few minutes we were relieved by Wake County EMS staff who continued to work on the employee.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 16:36 hours Ranger Ward and I stood down and spent a few minutes giving facts as we knew them to EMTs and to State Capitol Police.  By this time there was enough staff on hand that we were not needed for traffic control or for scene security.  The EMT staff put the employee on a stretcher and he was taken out the elevator loading dock at approximately 16:43 hours.  Ranger Ward and I cleared the scene at 16:45 hours (4:45 p.m.).\r\n\r\nOn April 23rd I contacted one of the contract employee\'s co-workers who informed me that he had been taken to the hospital and spent part of the weekend in a coma but that he had recovered from that and, as of the morning of the 23rd, he was awake and verbally responsive.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Nealson and Ranger Ward acted quickly, without hesitation, in a professional manner to assist in a team effort with an officer which they had never trained to save a DENR contract employeeâ€™s life. It is apparent that the immediate and professional actions taken by Superintendent Nealson, Ranger Ward lead to the survival of the individual.   Nealson and Wardâ€™s dedication to public service, the execution of their responsibilities and the compassion shown by their actions deserves recognition.\r\n','erik.nygard@ncdenr.gov','919-841-4059','','FALA','NODI','2012-10-05','','This Award was submitted simultaneously by Eric Dousharm from FALA.

Both Fred and Kay were founding members of the Gaston Conservation Society (Fred was the first and only treasurer).  The Gaston Conservation Society was a group instrumental in the early 1970s to protecting the park in perpetuity.  Fred and Kay were founding members of the Friends of Crowders Mountain, Inc. at its inception in 2000, and have been members since.  Fred has served as treasurer and both have served as Board members and continue to do so.  Fred and Kay have also personally funded projects at the park, including a $500 donation to revitalize the butterfly garden at the Visitor Center.   Quick story: at one Friends meeting I discussed our desire to purchase a park residence near the Boulders Access Area, which was listed for $185,000.  I mentioned that the homeowners were motivated to sell the house quickly, but that the state procedure for purchasing a house would take over one year.  Fred called me that evening and offered to pay for the house himself if we needed it quickly.   Kay has also worked and volunteered at the Schiele Museum, a city of Gastonia nature museum that the park partners with to provide I and E programs to the community.  Kay also worked with a small educational group to receive a $250 grant, used to present teacher workshops called â€œDiscovering Crowders Mountain,â€ a predecessor to the divisionâ€™s EELE program. Kay has provided programs at Friends meetings, our annual fall festival, and informally to Ranger staff.\r\n  \r\n\r\nProbably the most impressive character trait seen in both Fred and Kay is their ability to adapt to the changes both to the park and the Friends group.  Fred and Kay have been willing and able to use their past experience, but also look to the future, to provide valuable leadership to the Friends of Crowders Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                        \r\nI have nominated Fred and Kay collectively because, although they are two individuals with separate opinions and personalities, they work together in harmony to help CRMO keep the NC State Parkâ€™s mission statement in focus.!\r\n','larry.hyde@ncdenr.gov','704.853.5375','','CRMO','WEDI','2012-10-08','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Hyde9290,Hyde9290,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Howard6319,Howard6319,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Tillotson5212,Shimel1060,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','uploads/2012/AN_004_other_file_3_1380.doc',''),(5,'AN_005','2012','Award Presentation Complete','3','Lewis Wood','Mr. Lewis Wood is an original member of the Hanging Rock State Park Advisory Committee.  Since his appointment he has been a faithful and involved participant on the committee.  In 2005 Lewis instituted a project to bolster interpretation and education funding for Hanging Rock that has reaped exceptional results.  Lewis began making walking sticks and donating them to the park.   In a time consuming process he cuts saplings on his own property, cuts them to length, and sands them down.  He has several finishing processes.   Some sticks are done stripping the bark and left plain and others include burning patterns in the wood.   He coats the stripped sticks with urethane at his own expense.  He leaves the bark on selected species and whittles patterns in the bark.  To meet varying tastes Lewis drills a hole in some sticks and adds a leather wrist thong to the grip.  The most popular walking sticks are those that are twisted from a vine growing on them which require much care in de-barking.  Lewis brings stacks of sticks to the park several times a year which are then put on display.  Park visitors may have a walking stick if they put $10 in the park donation box, far below the going price for handmade sticks.  The donation box money goes to fund exhibits, literature, taxidermy, and supplies for the park interpretation and education efforts.  The sticks are enormously popular and the park cannot keep up with demand.  Children in particular want a Lewis Wood walking stick before they start out on the hiking trails.  In seven years Lewis has donated more than 400 walking sticks, which translates into more than $4000.00 for interpretation and education.   At the same time he has brought joy to hundreds of park visitors who left the park with their own Hanging Rock walking stick, serving as a reminder every time they use it of the good time they had at the park.','dave.cook@ncdenr.gov','(336)593-8480','','HARO','NODI','2012-10-11','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Cook4712,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Tillotson5212,Tillotson5212,Shimel1060,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(6,'AN_006','2012','Award Presentation Complete','5','Adam Carver','On August 1, 2008 at 12:05 Falls Lake Rangers Dave Mumford, Adam Carver and Former Ranger Paula Horstman responded by boat to a report of a man face Down in the water.  he had fallen from a jet ski.

In 1966 a group of concerned citizens gathered together to lobby against the idea of making a reservoir out of the Eno River.  Because of their efforts, in 1973 Governor Holshouser welcomed the Eno River State Park into the state parksâ€™ system.  It is likely that without the efforts of the Association, Eno River State Park would never have come into existence at all.\r\n\r\n	For the last four decades or so the Association has continued to support efforts to preserve and protect land along the entire Eno River, including Eno River State Park.  They have made so many things possible for the state park.  They have negotiated land deals, obtained conservation easements, and spent countless volunteer hours working in or near park lands.  Last year one of their employees took up the challenge of serving as lead contact for the parkâ€™s trail steward volunteer program.  His efforts allow park staff to concentrate on other volunteer efforts in the park.  \r\n\r\nThe Associationâ€™s efforts at educating the public have often intertwined with the parkâ€™s staff efforts, as we partner up for events like the New Years Day Hike, the Eno River Festival, and the iWalk the Eno educational camps each year.  They advertise our programs along with their programs and we do the same.  In this way we both reach the largest user group and thus maximize the educational opportunities.\r\n\r\n      It is very likely that the 1,000 acre Dubose tract added to the park in 2007 would not have happened without the assistance of the Association.  They helped in communications and survey fees.  In 2010 the Scarlett/Oâ€™dell heirs property, a 23 acre piece of property became available.  Because of the way it had been bequeathed to the family, 28 different people officially owned a piece of it and had to sign off on the sale.  The Association handled all the delicate negotiations and paperwork on this deal, realizing that the state did not have the necessary time to devote to it.  We were able to acquire this critical â€˜missing puzzle pieceâ€™ for river protection  because of their efforts.   As recently as 2011 the Association aided the park by purchasing a one acre parcel of land (the Links property) that was needed to complete a portion of the Mountains-to-sea Trail in the park.  They held the land while the necessary money was found and then sold it back to the state, insuring its future use as protected public land. \r\n\r\n	In the interest of full disclosure it should be noted that the Board of Directors of the Association does serve as the Eno River State Parkâ€™s Advisory committee.  But the Association itself is a stand alone certified Public Land Trust and 501c3 organization.  It has a separate mission statement and separate priorities from the park. It just so happens that their priorities and the parkâ€™s priorities mesh in a myriad of wonderful ways.\r\nThe Association is a partner to the park in so many ways that I think their dedication deserves this special recognition.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n-Sincerely,\r\n\r\nKeith Nealson\r\n\r\ncontact person for award-  ROBIN JACOBS, robin@enoriver.org or 919 620-9099 xt 202\r\n','keith.nealson@ncdenr.gov','(919) 383 1686','','ENRI','NODI','2012-10-16','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Nealson7511,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Tillotson5212,Shimel1060,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(12,'AN_012','2013','Award Presentation Complete','2','Jackie Cullipher','Angelia,                                                                              \r\n\r\nIn 2007 when the Red Fox really became a problem at FOFI staff knew something had to be done.  Former PASU Sean Mcelhone came up with an idea to get animal proof trash cans for the park.  This was a great idea and metal bins were ordered from Correction Enterprises and delivered to FOFI in June of 2007.  While a good plan these metal bins could not tolerate a salt water environment and were rusting out within a year.\r\n\r\nThese metal cans are extremely expensive.  In 2007 a single refuse bin was 484.35 a piece and a multiple can bin was 765.00.   The park purchased 4 multiple bins and 4 single ones the bill was 4,997.40.  That invoice is attached. Today the multiple bin is 955.00 a piece.  In 2009 I knew that these bins had to be replaced.  What should we do?  Go back with the same and get less than 2 years out of them or take another route.\r\n\r\nJackie Cullipher , former maintenance mechanic Mark Lawson and myself sat down and decided that we thought we could make these bins out of wood.  So the process began and animal proof bins were built very similar to the ones Corrections builds.  A great advantage of these bins however is they are light enough for one person to maneuver but yet still animal proof, with the exception of a bear which we currently donâ€™t have at FOFI.  As we roll into 2013 this will be the fourth summer using these bins.  They have held up extremely well and all bins that have been built are still in use.  We were also able to paint these bins and they match the exterior of the building making things look uniform.\r\n\r\nThe best part however is the money that has been saved.  The single bins are made from a single sheet of plywood and the multiple bins take two.  Other materials needed include hinges, screws, hooks and eye, bolts for the hinges, paint and 2 4X4â€™s.  When we built these it cost us 50.00 for a single bin and about 100.00 for the multiple one.  Many times we simply use scrap wood left over from other projects. Currently we have 18 single bins which cost us about 900.00 and one 3 bin container that cost about 100.00 .  So currently we have about 1000.00 dollars invested into all of these cans!!!  Look back at 2007 we had 8 total at 4,997.40.  That is a cost savings for the division of 3,997.40.  Today with costs rising letâ€™s say its 75 a single and 150 a multiple one.  This will still result in huge savings.  Also again we are going into our fourth year with these bins and the only thing that has been redone is painting. (42.00 dollars for 5 gallons not bad).  If we stayed with the metal we would be on our third set right now. Yikes!\r\n\r\nJack and Jessica even added a modification this year, which is where the hooks and eye come into place.  We started noticing that if the bins were extremely full the bag would tear while getting it out.  So now each bin has a â€œfront doorâ€ that can be removed to easily pull the bag out.\r\n\r\nThese bins are now being built and used at CABE.  I believe they are also going to be discussed at this yearâ€™s Maintenance Conference.  Just wanted to pass on this great cost savings measure at FOFI!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\nJeffrey T.Owen\r\nPark Superintendent \r\nFort Fisher State Recreation Area\r\n1000 Loggerhead Road\r\nKure Beach, NC 28449\r\n(910) 458-5798\r\nJeffrey.Owen@ncparks.gov\r\n','angelia.allcox@ncparks.gov','919-841-4058','Committee recognizes the hard work of all park staff, but see the real value in the development of the new style bin and the the committee recomends the award go to Jackie Cullipher as the designer and constructor of this project.','SODI','SODI','2013-02-19','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Allcox9961,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Williams5894,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','uploads/2013/AN_012_other_file_1_7817.JPG','uploads/2013/AN_012_other_file_3_6966.pdf','uploads/2013/AN_012_other_file_4_4355.JPG'),(13,'AN_013','2013','Award Presentation Complete','5','Kevin Bleck','On October 26, 2012, Ranger Kevin Bleck responded to incident of a 36 year old male having seizures in the Picnic Area.

Roosevelt, called by many as our countryâ€™s CONSERVATIONIST PRESIDENT would embark on an administration that would see the creation of the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service as we know it today. Under Teddy Roosevelt, citizens from all walks of life would begin to enjoy the beauty and splendor of places such as Crater Lake in Oregon, Wind Cove in South Dakota, Sullys Hill in neighboring North Dakota, Mesa Verde in Colorado and the Platt region of Oklahoma. Roosevelt recognized manâ€™s connection to his natural environment and used his bully pulpit to ensure that future generations would not be denied the pleasure of enjoying natural unspoiled lands. When the two-term president left office in 1909, his actions helped preserve and keep in the public domain more than 230 million acres. Six years later, many environmentally conscience North Carolinians channeled their energies and passion to create Mount Mitchell State Park beginning an endeavor that would grow to 35 state parks and four recreational areas throughout the state. The value of our state parks is not lost on the citizens and visitors who patronize our beautiful preserves. The tourists and guests who decide to visit have a profound impact on the local economies in which these parks are located. According to the Governorâ€™s office, outdoor recreation in North Carolina annually contributes $19.2 billion to our states economy with more than $400 million coming into state coffers as a direct result of people visiting our state parks. Now fast forward six decades or so, In the early 1970s, a young boy and his family began to call Swansboro home. Like many families, they were brought here by the military. Our Man of the Year would matriculate in its public schools and graduate from Swansboro High School in 1982. He would continue his higher learning by studying Computer Programming at Coastal Carolina Community College. While similar men such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellision were already involved in the same field of study and would help revolutionize the way we live, our man of the year embarked on a path of community service and public advocacy that some would argue had as much effect on those who he touched as the computer nerd drop outs from Harvard and denizens of Silicon Valley. In practically every organization in which he became affiliated, he not only became deeply involved but attained positions of leadership. In 1988, six years after graduating high school, he was accepted into the Swansboro Rotary, a civic group that states its members place service above self. He would attain leadership positions of secretary, Vice President and eventually President. He would expand his Rotarian reach when he became Assistant District Governor for Rotary International District 7730 for three years. He valued public service and ran for a seat on the town board. He was elected Swansboro Town Commissioner in 1997 serving one term. He held leadership positions on the board of directors of the Jacksonville Board of Realtors serving as its President in 1999. He gave back to his alma mater by serving on the board and being its president of the Swansboro High School Century Club from 2003 to 2012. He currently serves on the Swansboro Tourism Development Authority as well as on the Sea Turtle Advisory Committee. And of course, he is a fellow chamber member. But it was a seemingly innocuous boat ride with his wife by his side and Park Superintendent Sam Bland on board that led to our Man of the Year into getting involved knee deep in the comings and goings of Hammocks Beach State Park when he innocently asked how do things get done here. In so many words during a short 15-minute cruise to the unspoiled barrier island, Bland simply stated, â€œthe squeaky wheel gets the grease.â€ Bland had no idea what those six words ignited inside our Man of the Year. From that day forward, he has been applying the lubricant. I bet there isnâ€™t a member of our Stateâ€™s Senate or General Assembly who has been within earshot of him who isnâ€™t aware by now his passion for the Hammocks Beach State Park and its pristine sand dunes, changing channels and beloved sea turtles. And Iâ€™ll read word for word from outline written about our Man of the Year as provided to me by the woman who knows him bestâ€”his wife: â€œHe has worked tirelessly to protect the remaining 289 acres of the Hammocks Beach Corporation from being developed and advocated for the property to become part of HBSP.â€ The irony in those words is that our Man of the Yearâ€™s 9 to 5 job is that of a Swansboro real estate agent who in most situations would love nothing more than to have more waterfront property come onto the market. But I believe our Man of the Year has other reasons why he chooses to preserve this land. I bet heâ€™s doing for future generations. Perhaps for the two young ladies seated next to him tonight. For when daughters Jessica and Kristen, both Swansboro girls and alumna of Wake Forest, return home years later with their families and enjoy a day on Bear Island they can tell their children, â€œyour grand daddy helped preserve this local treasure.â€ Jessica and Kristen, please join me and your mother Pam in presenting your father David as the Swansboro Area Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year. To all, I present David Pearson, the 2013 SACC Man of the Year.

For the last 19 years she has served as a part time weekend office assistant and a very frequent volunteer for the park.  She has handed out information, told stories, and managed campers and other reservations.  She has greeted each customer with a smile and a good attitude. During the week when the full time office assistant asked for time off Jane would frequently volunteer to come in and work for no pay, and during her time in the park she has logged in more than 1,500 volunteer hours. (It is likely more than that-  Jane often didn\'t fill out the volunteer sheet, saying that she was not doing this kind of thing for recognition).  \r\nJane has helped to develop and maintain infomational materials for the public.  Jane has always maintained a level of professionalism far above the normal expectations. She has served as a fountain of wisdom about the people and places throughout the park, a local historian who regaled the staff and park visitors with entertaining stories about the cultural history of the area.  In many ways Jane has been the heart and soul of the park.\r\nJane is in her eighties and failing health has caused her to have to tender her resignation.  She still wants to volunteer, but the idea of her being alone in the office has her worried that she might not be able to provide sufficient customer service.  She made it clear in her letter of resignation that she was resigning for the sake of the park\'s well being, not hers. I am absolutely sure that this is the truth, as she has always put the interests of the park she loves above her own.\r\nI think it would be an absolute shame not to recognize this fine woman for 19 years of dedicated service to Eno River State park and to the citizens of and visitors to North Carolina.\r\n','keith.nealson@ncparks.gov','9193831686','It would be helpful to see examples of the informational materials Mrs. Umstead developed for the park.

Keith Nealson leads by example, with his work ethic and his professionalism.  He has and will continue to be my mentor because of the way he chooses to interact with staff and customers of state parks.  He is a testament to using his words to solve difficult issues which includes low staffing issues and how it affects trail maintenance.  He developed a program through our Park committee, the Eno River Association, called Trail stewards.  One week a month, the Trail Stewards work as small teams, hike trails and to do small maintenance on park trails.  They contact the park staff members who are responsible for specific trails when they see a hazard, which enables park staff to assess and handle problems quickly and efficiently. Keith Nealson wrote up a guideline for this group and made it happen.  Twice this year, he has conducted a training to teach these volunteers and maintain best practices to ensure safe work while they are in the park.  This program leads patrons of the park to build a personal relationship with the park and also ensures our mission statement of operating state parks that provide recreational use of natural resources and outdoor recreation in natural surroundings. \r\nAnother example of his leadership of Eno River State Park is the construction of a comfortable work environment that allows his staff to excel at their strengths and improve on their weaknesses.  Nealson is a joyful worker and this lifts morale of park staff even in difficult times.  The park has experienced a high level of new law enforcement challenges coupled with the loss of 3 permanent park positions that are vital to our success to continue a high level of service to the constituentsâ€™ of North Carolina.  He has struggled to handle all the expectations we are given.  It is our duty to keep people safe and we have managed in a large part to Keith Nealsonâ€™s leadership. His support from his position is wielded with a confident grace.    In the face of this, many folks would falter, but Nealson has not.  Nealson creates a true teamwork atmosphere in the park, where all staff work together for a common goal of providing an excellent state park and safe family fun.  State parks allow anyone to enjoy our natural world, Nealson upholds our mission by example.\r\nNealson is an extraordinarily talented educational interpreter. He encourages his staff to give better than average programs.  Every staff member who is interested may learn and give programs to visitors.  We have become a great resource for seasonal staff to cut their teeth at teaching environmental curricula, which helps them prepare for a park ranger interview and continue to serve our division.  We have given a huge amount of programs compared to the few amount of hours permanent staff have to work at programming, in part to Nealsonsâ€™ leadership and willingness to be creative with how we serve our visitors with what we have to give.  We have given good programs despite meager funding for more work expected.  Nealson maintains and expects excellence and we all work to provide that for him and our visitors.  Despite the challenges of running a largely visited park with an ever decreasing budget Keith Nealson has done a stellar job that is more than the average bear.  He deserves to be recognized for his effort with the Thomas C. Ellis Award or another award of excellence equal to his merits.\r\n','jack.singley@ncparks.gov','919-383-1686','','ENRI','NODI','2013-08-02','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','No','','','','0000-00-00','','Singley4600,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','','uploads/2013/AN_017_other_file_3_6202.doc',''),(18,'AN_018','2013','Award Presentation Complete','1','Jane Mary Umstead','On August 1, 2013, Jane Mary Umstead submitted her resignation at Eno River State Park.  It wasnâ€™t an easy decision for her, as she has worked at Eno River for 19 years in various positions.  That might not seem too extraordinary until you consider that Jane started working at our park after her first retirement when she was 66 years of age.  She began by working in a part-time permanent position.   When the OA position went to full time, she regularly volunteered.  Finally when parks were given seasonal office assistant positions, Jane was the first.  She knew how to greet and direct people to their park destinations and also knew how to suggest various activities that would interest individuals, sometimes by sharing bits of park history.  You see, Jane grew up and still lives just a couple of miles from the park, so she is full of historical facts about this area.  Sheâ€™s also an outdoor gal, loves camping and hiking; she still goes with her nieces once a year on a camping trip to the Toe River in western NC.  Jane is full of character and park visitors enjoy her knowledge of the area and past story events she shares. \r\n\r\nI remember one time she came to work, looking quite proud of herself, and I asked her what she had been up to that day.  She went on to tell me that she had some annoying crows at her house that liked to sit on her roof but she had solved the problem.  Whenever the crows decided to gather for their â€œmeetingâ€ on her roof, she would just take her gun out into her yard, point it Heavenward and let â€˜er rip.  Yep, the crows werenâ€™t hurt but got the message loudly.  This was not a story that she shared with the public!\r\n\r\nJane M Umstead loves the Division of Parks and Recreation and especially Eno River State Park.  We havenâ€™t seen the last of Jane, I am sure.  She will be the first one we will call to volunteer in the office when needed and as usual, she will excitedly respond.  \r\n\r\nI would like to proudly nominate Jane Mary Umstead for the Thomas C Ellis award.\r\n\r\nKaren Wilson\r\n','karen.wilson@ncparks.gov','919-383-1686','','ENRI','NODI','2013-08-06','','','','','','No','','No','','','','0000-00-00','','Wilson2631,Wilson2631,Wilson2631,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(19,'AN_019','2013','Award Presentation Complete','2','Bruce Rountree','Dismal Swamp State Park boardwalk project.  \r\n\r\nMaintenance Mechanics Bruce Rountree and Carlton Griffin worked tirelessly over a 2 year period to complete a Â½ mile loop boardwalk for the benefit of all park visitors.

Her love of the park runs deep.   Upon her retirement from the Methodist Retirement Home, where she served as an administrative assistant, Jane immediately volunteered to serve as an office assistant at the park.  During those days the park had only a part time morning office assistant and Jane on most days would cover the afternoon in the park office Monday â€“ Friday so someone would be there to assist park visitors and answer the telephone.  Frequently she volunteered twenty hours a week.  In 1994 the park was awarded a full time permanent office assistant, however the current office assistant did not desire full time work so a job sharing situation was arranged.  Jane continued right on with her afternoon shifts, only now getting paid for the job she loved.  This continued for more than a year when the original office assistant left and the job shares were merged into a full time position.  Jane, not wishing to work full time, stepped back out of her role as a permanent part-time staff member and went back to volunteering.  She shifted her time to the weekends as the park had never been able to open the office to the public on the very days when public information and assistance was most needed.  In 1997 the park was granted funding for a seasonal office assistant.  This was arranged into two positions working alternating weekends.  From that time until August 2013, Jane has faithfully worked two to three weekends every month in the park office.  Many times when the permanent office assistant was on leave, Jane was right back in the office during the week, volunteering her time unpaid so someone would be there for the visitors and telephone.  She did not have to be asked.  When she heard the office assistant would be gone would ask if she could come in to help.  For many years she volunteered at the Eno River Festival state park booth or volunteered to cover the office unpaid so the permanent office assistant could work at the festival.  There is no record of how many visitors that came into the office, or persons on the telephone were helped by Jane as she with great care gave directions, promoted programs, told people about the wonderful things to see in the park, told people the rules, registered campers, and radioed rangers of reported emergencies.  But in 20 years, those people helped have to number in the tens of thousands.  She was a constant help to the staff with administrative duties, always enthusiastic about helping the staff for whom she cared for immensely.  Now after 20 years, at an age Jane does not wish to talk about (but approaching the nine decades mark)she has decided it is time to step away from park work and announced her resignation.  This was a difficult decision as her love of the park has not waned.','dave.cook@ncparks.gov','(919) 841-4059','','NODI','NODI','2013-08-23','','','','','','No','','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Cook4712,Cook4712,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(23,'AN_023','2013','Award Presentation Complete','2','Garry Hoover, Gary Pippen','Garry Hoover and Gary Pippen, maintenance mechanics at Hanging Rock, have constructed a new vault toilet building at group camp.

By doing the work themselves, instead of contracting it out, this special effort saved the state approximately $13,000.00 .  Lance White estimates that if it had been contacted, it would have cost well over $30,000.00\r\n4. This vault toilet also provides and ADA accessible restroom to group camp, which was not available before. This is a highly desirable benefit, as it further allows an additional type of user to experience the park. \r\n5. Creative efforts were used in two ways. They used wood and natural colors on the siding, and finished the concrete floor to have the color and texture of natural stone, in keeping with the guidelines, keeping the building look and feel appropriate for the park atmosphere. Also, since there is no electricity at group camp, they are installing high efficiency LED lighting, run by solar recharged batteries. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n','robin.Riddlebarger@ncparks.gov','336-593-8480','','HARO','NODI','2013-08-28','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','','Riddlebarger1629,Oneal1133,Peek1873,Tillotson5212,Oneal1133,Oneal1133','','','uploads/2013/AN_023_other_file_1_4624.jpg','',''),(24,'AN_024','2013','DENIED pending review - comments below','5','Chandler Reich, Grace Pryor','Chandler Reich and Grace Pryor are seasonals at Hanging Rock, employed as Lifeguards at Hanging Rock Lake. \r\nOn Tuesday, July 23, 2013, Pryor and Reich were on duty at the lake.

Although the location was off of the park property, they proceeded to location to offer assistance.  Upon arriving at the scene, there were already many local first responders and parking and access to the scene was limited.  They parked their vehicle about 200 yards away from the scene and almost immediately after arriving, they heard another canoeist on the river shout, \"There he is!\"  The victim was located just downstream from the location where they had parked.  As some public citizens retrieved the victim from the river Joe and Jamie were the first responders to arrive at the victim\'s location.  The immediately began CPR, with Jamie maintaining the victim\'s airway and Joe beginning chest compressions and continued performing CPR while other medical responders loaded the victim onto a backboard.  \r\n\r\nThe victim was later pronounced dead and was estimated to have been underwater for approximately 20 minutes.  However, Joe and Jamie\'s response is a great example of always being prepared to act and respond to any incident.  After arriving on scene with many other higher trained medical responders, they could have expected to help direct traffic or perform crowd control.  However, the ability to quickly respond enabled them to be the first responders to begin treating the victim.

However as discussions began with Exhibit Technician Martin Kane and I&E Program Manager Sean Higgins the idea significantly expanded into a Visitor Center-type series of exhibits.  Everyone on the work group was supportive of the expanded idea, however, there was no opportunity to pursue additional funding to pay for professional exhibit contractors.  Realizing what an amazing opportunity the park had to offer a quality I&E experience like no other in the NC State Park system, the park staff offered to devote a considerable amount of time and effort into trying to build the exhibits themselves.  All of the text was written by park staff.  All of the exhibits were constructed and installed entirely by park staff and completed with a budget of $12,000.\r\n\r\nThrough 18 station of activities, signs and structures an experience was created that is whimsical, relaxing, challenging, thought provoking and inspiring.  Using natural materials as much as possible, the park staff constructed and installed a \"Build a Fairy House,\" where children can use natural materials to construct small trail side habitats; \"Walk like a Raccoon,\" where children have to walk across a balance beam, mimicking a raccoon; \"Wild Percussion,\" which is a 12 foot tall exhibit with hollowed-out logs against which children can beat a mallet, mimicking a Pileated Woodpecker; and many other creative and interactive exhibits.  The result is the now completed Holly Discovery Trail.  The Holly Discovery Trail represents the most extensive exhibit project completely written, designed, constructed and installed entirely in-house.\r\n\r\nRecently the Division was awarded a First Place award by the National Association for Interpretation for the Wayside Exhibit category.\r\n\r\nThe completion of this project, could not have been accomplished without the incredible work performed by each member of the team.  Each team member brought unique skills and talents to the project.

Contact: Jane Conolly, 910.436-4681.','As the park superintendent of Carvers Creek State Park, I, Jane Conolly am proud to nominate my staff for the Special Achievement Award for 2013.  This would include the seasonal staff.  \r\n\r\n	In July 2012 I started my tenure as the park superintendent at Carvers Creek State Park.  At that time I taught the staff, all new to state parks, what the divisionâ€™s Mission Statement is and what it means.  I taught them that state parks are a critical part of our society providing safe outdoor recreation not only to the benefits of physical fitness, but also to the enrichment of the human mind and spirit.  I told the staff we teach people stewardship and understanding of our natural resources.  Also, that we protect and manage these recreational and natural resources as we are in the forever business.   We discussed the role of safety not only in relation to their daily assignments, but also how important public safety was in the park.\r\n\r\n	Then I challenged them to join me in the goal of completing the interim development project and getting Carvers Creek State Park open to the public as soon as our time and resources would allow.  I am so proud to say my staff rose to that challenge and took it forward in a determined and dedicated manner.  All members of the staff had their role to play and they all worked very hard from the first week of July 2012 to September 9, 2013 when the park opened its gates to the public.\r\n\r\n	Park Ranger Colleen Bowers worked tirelessly developing wayside panels, two informational panels, a park brochure, researching the cultural and natural history of the park, developed an Interpretation and Education program, worked on many maintenance projects, provided leadership while the park was without a superintendent, for many months was the parkâ€™s safety officer, developed a detailed knowledge of the parkâ€™s land, and all while working towards her Environment Education Certification and the complex and varied duties as a ranger.  She also worked to support operations and I&E at Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve and Raven Rock State Park.\r\n\r\n	Maintenance Mechanic LeRoy Boles worked closely with Pete Mitchell, SODI MM V, and me to take up the task of building the physical elements of the park such as picnic areas, renovation of buildings, fences, installing signs, road repair, culverts, installation of a water line, and many, many more.  LeRoy did all these things fulfilling routine maintenance for a park with over 60 structures including two residences and a large shop complex.  LeRoy worked closely with me to oversee the complex interim development project by working closely with all contractors.  He and I kept contractors on task ensuring quality work and reducing costs.  He has been the parkâ€™s safety officer since January 2013 and has taken the parkâ€™s safety program to very high standards.   He has provided excellent leadership to the seasonal staff by teaching them many skills and demonstrating a strong work ethic.  \r\n\r\n	My seasonal staff to include: Julian Miller, Daniel Moniz, and Alex Yott have not only worked very hard at routine seasonal tasks, but have in fact completed a lot of work at a Maintenance Mechanic I or II level.  They have done this work at seasonal pay, with no benefits, and all of them have worked for the division for more than a year and a half.   LeRoy, the seasonal staff, and I agreed that they would complete their assigned tasks with the added benefit of learning new skills under the capable tutelage of LeRoy.  This seasonal staff has so many times put their dedication of purpose, muscle, and skills to the tasks at hand that it makes me very proud.  They have worked in all kinds of weather and met many goals.  Carvers Creek State Park could simply not have been opened without their work and dedication.  \r\n\r\n        At this risk of sounding conceded I will simply say that my own contribution to the goal of getting Carvers Creek State Park open has been to try to lead by example, provide leadership in a manner that kept projects moving forward, provided staff with needed resources, and development of a teamwork approach.  I would have to leave it to others to decide if I have succeeded.  \r\n\r\n	As July 2012 flew into July 2013 the staff and I kept thinking we were surly nearly ready to open the park.  So much had been completed.  However, as the interim development project neared completion the tasks of getting the park opened seemed to take on a life of their own growing more and more every day.  For example, with the park office building physically in place the amount of work to furnish it, organize, set-up communications, work stations, services and resources for the public was a huge undertaking of its own.  Office Assistant Steven Childers started working at this position during the first week of February 2013 and during that time he has been critical to moving the park to the last seven months until opening day in September.  Steve has dedicated himself to learning all the OA tasks and he did so in a short amount of time and to very good effect.  He was instrumental in getting the park office itself open and operational.  He freed me from many of the OA duties that I had been doing for seven months which allowed me to spend more time on moving the interim development project and other park goals forward.  As a member of the Wounded Warrior Program at Fort Bragg Steve completed many hours of volunteer work at the park before his employment.  \r\n\r\n	With all the work the staff has completed to get Carvers Creek State Park opened they did so while also supporting other parks on many projects or staffing needs especially at WEWO and RARO.  Colleen has assisted with the PIMO fire and the MOMO storm clean-up.   LeRoy assisted with the MOMO clean-up as well.   I have been the acting superintendent for WEWO since July 1, 2013.\r\n\r\n	Park staff has also maintained a burn program, volunteer program, worked on invasive plants removal projects, attended all regular training requirements, presented monthly safety meetings, kept-up with mowing and other routine park maintenance tasks.  Senior park staff has worked closely with many division sections such as the trails, natural resources, land protection, engineering and construction, and others on many projects and needs.\r\n\r\n	Now that the park is open the staff has worked hard and successfully to meet the needs of park visitors.   We have established opening, closing, and cleaning routines.  We are providing access to the parkâ€™s Mill pond to the disabled and elderly.  I&E programs are being presented.  We are getting much positive feedback from the park visitors in relation to what we are providing to them.  This is a direct reflection on all our hard work.  An example project was the emergency creation of an overflow parking lot as the 19 spaces provided by the interim development was wholly insufficient.  On nice weather weekends we are maintaining parking for 60 to 70 vehicles at all times.        \r\n\r\n	So how can I share with you, the Awards Committee just how much the Carvers Creek staff have accomplished in the last year and three months?  It is a daunting task in itself so I have listed below some of our, â€œTo Do,â€ lists.  These by no means list every task, job, and project we have completed, but it gives you a good idea of what the staff has accomplished.  Please take a look at these pages below my closing.  \r\n\r\n     	In closing I respectfully submit the staff of Carvers Creek State Park for the Special Achievement Award for 2013.   I submit that the staff has worked shoulder to shoulder on many difficult projects well above and beyond what is routinely expected of a park staff for day to day operations including the seasonal staff.   Only a handful of division staff knows what it takes to open a park, but I can honestly say it is a huge undertaking which this staff has met to a very high standard.   Please look at the two lists an idea of the work projects completed by park staff.   These lists although not complete give a good example of the work completed.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nJane Conolly, Park Superintendent\r\nCarvers Creek State Park\r\n910.436.4681\r\nJane.conolly@ncparks.gov\r\n\r\nCACR Project Lists July 2012 to 2013\r\n\r\nNote: RH = Rockefeller House\r\n\r\nInterim Development: Highest Priority\r\nïƒ˜	Name things!

I was on patrol of the four wheel drive beach at the time.  I radioed Maintenance Mechanic Jessica Sutton to respond with rescue equipment and find the exact location.  I arrived on scene approximately 5 minutes later.\r\n I could see 6 individuals in a group struggling and continuing to drift out.  I took off my defensive equipment and gave it to a Kure Beach Officer that arrived on scene.  I then took 2 rescue cans and entered the water.  To the side of me was a gentleman assisting a group of 3 other swimmers and seemed to be doing good getting them in.  I swam out to the group of six, with one other gentleman who I gave a rescue can to.  They were pretty tired when I got to them.  I first made sure everyone was alright and made sure that all parties were accounted for which they were.  At that point I encouraged them to start kicking and trying to swim to the side.  By this point I knew we were in a pretty bad rip current.  We were making slow progress, when 2 more responders form Kure Beach entered the water.  Although still a struggle we all made it back to shore.  I estimate that I was in the water at least 20 minutes and initially got to the group about 100 yards off shore.  All parties were evaluated by EMS and all left on their own power.\r\nInitially all of these adults had responded to the water to rescue 5 children who got caught in the rip current. I was informed the ages of the children were 12, 12, 11, 10, and 9. \r\nThe Kure Beach responders that assisted were Bass and Heglar (last names only).  The names of the group of 6 that we rescued were; Ron and Austin Jenkins, Hector Santiago, Joshua Dankosky, Jonathan Craig, and Dori Painter.\r\n\r\nThe scene was cleared at 1610.\r\n','jay.greenwood@ncparks.gov','1-919-841-4058','','SODI','SODI','2014-04-30','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 Awarded in 2014.dw','Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Caudle3874,Tillotson5212,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894','','','','',''),(31,'AN_031','2014','Award Granted','3','Kirk Keller, 919-739-6815','Fort Macon State Park would like to nominate the Applied Technologies Division of Wayne Community College for the Locke Craig Award.  In 2009, a partnership was established between this division of Wayne Community College and the N. C. Division of State Parks to construct functional, full-scale replicas of 19th century cannon carriages as permanent outdoor exhibits for the interpretation of Fort Macon State Park.  Previously, two wooden replica cannon carriages used by the park for several years on top of the fort had become decayed in the coastal environment to the point they were a physical hazard to park visitors.  The park was seeking to replace these with maintenance-free replica cannon carriages made of aluminum, which have been used by the National Park Service with great success.  However, the going price for aluminum carriages from commercial sources was $40,000 to $50,000 apiece.\r\nFortunately, Wayne Community College came to the rescue to assist the Division of State Parks.  Their industrial program was large enough to take on such a project to build the aluminum cannon carriage itself, and at a great monetary savings for the state. This proved to be the largest project of its kind ever undertaken at the college that involved all its industrial classes: Mechanical Engineering Technologies classes to convert old 1860s military drawings of cannon carriages to modern blueprint and Computer Assisted Drawing (CAD) format, and Computer Integrated Machining and Welding Technologies classes to do the actual work of building the cannon carriage.  The project would be beneficial both to the college and to State Parks by garnering much work experience, public attention and interest in the collegeâ€™s industrial programs, as well as help State Parks by replacing rotten, hazardous wood cannon carriages with maintenance-free carriages at considerable savings to the state.  The college would build the new cannon carriage for only the cost of materials, while its students would gain vast practical experience in the fabrication of the carriage.  \r\nWork started on the project in the fall of 2009 and was completed in 2010.  The students of the various technologies programs received invaluable training as they collaborated on the project.  They were involved in all phases from the drawing board to fabrication, assembly and completion. The total cost of the cannon carriage was $22,000 (including some parts that had to be subcontracted), a savings to the State of North Carolina of $28,000.\r\nDuring 2011 Wayne Community College completed two additional cannon carriages under the same arrangement in time to observe the Sesquicentennial of the battle of Fort Macon in 1862.  Replica 32-pounder cannons were mounted on all three of the cannon carriages, which made possible their use in reenacted â€œbombardmentsâ€ during the Sesquicentennial observances.  In addition, the cost saving to the State for the three cannon carriages totaled in excess of $80,000 as opposed to purchasing three carriages from commercial vendors.  The cannons have since been used in public demonstrations and reenactments as part of the parkâ€™s historical interpretive program.\r\nIn July, 2014, Wayne Community College agreed to construct two more aluminum replica cannon carriages under the same agreement to enable Fort Macon State Park to restore another part of the fortâ€™s armament in time for the centennial anniversary observance of the founding of North Carolina State Parks in 2016.\r\nThe partnership between the Applied Technologies Division of Wayne Community College and N. C. State Parks has resulted in the creation of three outdoor interpretive exhibits at Fort Macon State Park that most likely would not otherwise exist.  It has benefitted N. C. State Parks and the citizens of North Carolina in helping further the historic interpretation of one of the most important historic sites in North Carolina, as well as resulted in a savings to the State of over $80,000.  For these reasons, the public spirit, helpfulness and hard work of the Applied Technologies Division of Wayne Community College is most deserving of recognition by bestowing upon it the Locke Craig Award.\r\n\r\n','paul.branch@ncparks.gov','252-726-3775','','FOMA','EADI','2014-08-15','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','No','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 This award is on CHOP desk awaiting awarding it to Mr. Keller or Wayne Community College.

He also volunteers individually as a living history reenactor in various park interpretive programs each year.  By virtue of his extensive workshop at his home, he has been able to make repairs to various items of park equipment free of charge.  He has also fabricated replicas of historic military equipment to be used for display in exhibits in the fort museum.  He has made donations of supplies for living history programs at the fort and through his efforts donations of expensive workshop equipment have been made to the park maintenance department.  He was also instrumental in having an original Civil War sword once used at Fort Macon purchased by his reenacting unit, the 1st North Carolina, and donated to the parkâ€™s museum.\r\nMr. Greiner continues to be an active volunteer that the park has come to rely upon in so many capacities.

She has served as chair of the Umstead Coalition since 1993 and is a long time member of the park advisory committee.  Through the Umstead Coalition, Dr. Spooner has raised tremendous support and donations for the park and has helped to protect the park from a major road being constructed through the park and represented the park in numerous political decisions concerning the park both with the City of Raleigh and the State of North Carolina.  Dr. Spooner has assisted the park with submitting grants that have led to over $60,000 for park protection and preservation and has also helped the park in acquiring several critical parcels of land adjacent to the park.  Jean Spooner\'s contributions have been many and it is impossible to begin to document the number of hours spent and ways her efforts have assisted the park.  Dr. Spooner is very humble about her efforts so much of this work goes unrecorded.  The following though are some examples of her service to the park:\r\n\r\n-In 1993, NCDOT had plans to construct a road through the middle of Umstead State Park.  The route this road would have created would have negatively impacted the natural resources of the park and the road would have been heavily traveled by Raleigh commuter traffic.  Jean was able to organize the community to speak out against the project.  She intervened on many levels working with local and state politicians to stop the project.  Her efforts resulted in several additional protections for the park including having a large section of park property come under the dedicated nature preserve act, the National Resister of Historic Places, protection in Raleigh zoning codes, and numerous other land protections that continue to benefit the park.\r\n\r\n-To have more time for her volunteer efforts, Dr. Spooner negotiated a reduction in her work hours and salary with NC State University.  Despite the reduction in hours and salary, she continued to complete all the duties and responsibilities of a department Chair and also dedicate a tremendous amount of personal time to the park both in fund raising/advocacy work and also many meetings with State and local officials. \r\n\r\n-Dr. Spooner is very experience with local and state government procedure.  She is able to speak on the parks behalf and advocate for the park.  She also has the ability to do this in the proper and positive way to build relationships and promote the park. She is able to represent the park in a productive manner.\r\n\r\n-Dr. Spooner has assisted with acquiring several sections of land to add to the park including 84 acres from the adjacent Angus Barn.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to place a value on the ways Jean Spooner has benefited William B. Umstead State Park.  Without her help and advocacy, the park would be a much different place.

Their development of the BIT (basic interpretive training) program has added a level of consistency in our training of new interpreters.  Their development and ongoing modification of the AIT (advanced interpretive training) systems has allowed for park staff to instruct on and learn about many new topics that are culturally and ecologically relevant to our public presentations.  I was particularly grateful when the Council modified the AIT system to make it blend with the requirements for maintaining active ee certification. The establishment of rewards for completing AIT cycles was a great improvement (and incentive) to the system. \r\n The councilâ€™s latest effort at establishing a new â€˜I&E Mindmeldâ€™ website to allow for better sharing of division resources and ideas is brilliant and much needed.\r\nThe majority of the I&E council members are not required to be on the council.  They do it of their own free will with the intention of bettering their division, their department, and their state.\r\n \r\nThis is challenging time in state parks for environmental education as a whole.  When I was first hired with the parks system 16 years ago it was hammered into me that Interpretation and Education was the park rangerâ€™s number one priority.  Since that time staff and funding has shrunk while hours of operation and administrative and public safety duties have expanded.  This has in some ways made I&E less of a priority as we struggle to make operational ends meet.  In these challenging times the efforts towards the critical job of educating the public about the importance of their natural world needs champions.  I think the council in many ways serves as one of those champions.  Please consider awarding the council this special achievement award.\r\nThe current council consists of the following members- Sharon Becker, Kevin Bischof, Brian Bockhahn, Jeff Davidson, Renee Evans, Sean Higgins, Brittany Hurtado, Bill Meyer, Adrian Oâ€™Neal, Timothy Rayworth, Kathryn Royall, Jack Singley, Mary Smith, and Jessie Summers.  I think each one of those members truly deserves a special thank you, so I am nominating the council as a whole.  Should the award committee decide to recognize it with an award the three primary people that should be contacted are Adrian Oâ€™Neal (East District Superintendent), Sean Higgins (Divison I&E coordinator) and Jack Singley (chair of the council).\r\n','keith.nealson@ncparks.gov','9193831686','','ENRI','NODI','2014-09-25','','','No','Yes','No','No','No','No','','','','0000-00-00','','Nealson7511,Tillotson5212,Peek1873,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Bash8938,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Oneal1133','','','','',''),(45,'AN_045','2014','Award Presentation Complete','2','Pam Pearson','I would like to nominate Pam Pearson for a much deserved Special Achievement Award in November 2014.

There are employees all across our division who are working extremely hard every day to help our park system grow and who are providing excellent customer service.  One such person who has been working at Hammocks Beach for the past six and half years is Office Assistant Pam Pearson.  Pam has been an asset not only to park visitors but to park staff as well.  Pam conducts her regular duties as an Office Assistant at the park in a very proficient manner. She is always available to help seasonal and permanent staff with administrative tasks, payroll problems and park operations.\r\n\r\nPam is quick to volunteer to be on a planning committee for park related events such as Military Appreciation Day, Paddle Festival, Seasonal Orientation and other Hammocks Beach Friends Group activities as well as Friends of State Park Conferences.  In addition to park event planning, Pam has volunteered to be on the Centralized Reservation Committee and has participated in weekly and bi-monthly telephone conferences to implement and improve the system.  She has tested new CRS programs and has implemented operational procedures at HABE through the CRS that have streamlined point-of-sale procedures for ferry ticket sales, seasonal uniform sales, and special activity permits.  \r\n\r\nDuring the past year, when no one volunteered to be the secretary for the parkâ€™s friends group, she took on that task and recorded the minutes of quarterly meetings and updated the FHBI website.  She is also working this year with friend group members in organizing the parkâ€™s popular marsh cruises which will be led for the first time by park volunteers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to keeping her husband, David Pearson, President of FHBI and President of Friends of State Parks on task and out of trouble (which is a full-time job in itself), she often keeps me abreast of daily park operational situations and needs.  The past couple of years Pam volunteered to be on the APC Council and this year was the chairperson for this DPR training session.  As you can see in the nomination below by Chief of Operations Office Assistant, Denise Williams; Pam has put forth an enormous amount time developing presentations for this training session that would be beneficial to all Office Assistants across the division.

Most notably, Blake put in significant hours along side Joe on a restoration project in the park.  Over 100 historic buildings (cabins and dining halls) were restored at the park completely by volunteers funded by grants.  Joe and Blake coordinated all of the volunteer labor for the project and each put in significant hours of their time working on the cabins.  Without Joe and Blake organizing and driving the project, I do not believe the project would have been completed.  Working together, Joe and Blake managed 5,182 volunteer hours on the REI project alone.  During this project, we have in our records Blake Norwood completing at least 640 hours of volunteer work himself and I suspect the actual number of hours is even higher but everything may not have been recorded.\r\n\r\nJoe and Blake have also worked together on trail work in the park, have donated equipment to the park including a new freezer for a dining hall and a gas powered pole trimmer the maintenance staff needed.\r\n\r\nBlake leaves behind a very nice wife who has always supported him and she has been a part of the park family right along with Blake.  I know that she is going to miss him greatly and have a hard time adjusting to life without her husband.  I\'m hoping that an opportunity to award Blake along with Joe will give her a nice memory and create an opportunity for us to have her out to the park to recognize her husband\'s impact he had on everyone.\r\n\r\nThis award would mean a lot to Blake\'s wife and to Joe Lugiano. \r\n\r\n','scott.letchworth@ncparks.gov','919-571-4170','','WIUM','NODI','2014-10-31','','','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','0000-00-00','6/23/2015 Awarded in 2014.dw','Letchworth5004,Letchworth5004,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Caudle3874,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Peek1873,Bash8938,Oneal1133,Oneal1133,Williams5894','','','','',''),(53,'AN_053','2015','','2','Ryan Newsome','Last year in the spring of 2014 Park Ranger Ryan Newsome was tasked with the project of applying for an Americorps crew to help us get a handle on our exotic invasive species problem here at Medoc Mountain State Park. \r\nRyan developed a plan of action, put together an exotic invasive species removal plan, and coordinated this plan with the divisionâ€™s Natural Resource section. Ryan then began the lengthy process of applying with Americorps for a team. He began a search to find them a place to stay and found a place at the 4-H camp in the town of Halifax. Ryan was advised that his application had been accepted and that the park would be getting a team of eight in the month of March 2015. He met with the county 4-H Director, Joe Long and worked out a plan for the team to stay there and also volunteer some of their time to work on improvements to that facility. \r\nRyan met in person with the Americorps representative and gave them a tour of our facilities, the 4-H facility, and showed them what the team would be doing. When the eight member team arrived he did all the necessary orientation with them, making sure they had an understanding of where they were and what was expected of them both here at the park and at the 4-H center. They all received gift packets from Halifax County Convention and Visitors Bureau with things to do and see. Ryan also arranged a canoeing outing, and complimentary tickets to visit Sylvan Heights Waterfowl Park in Scotland Neck, NC to help fill their spare time.\r\nIn order to properly execute the Exotic Invasive Species removal plan Ryan attended the North Carolina Pesticide Applicators Licensing course and passed the exam, determined how much and what type of pesticide to purchase, ensured that we had all of the necessary tools and equipment, gave the team a safety briefing on the use of the hand tools, chemical applications, and the proper use of the parkâ€™s chipper. Ryan continuously worked with the team operating the chain saw, and supervising the progress and quality of the work. \r\nOne of the requirements Ryan put on the team was to put together and give a 30 minute program to the public at the park on what they did at the end of their assignment, which they did an excellent job!\r\nOn the last day of their assignment, Ryan and his family supplied and cooked a thank you and farewell dinner for them that was served at the picnic shelter.\r\nDue to the time and effort that Ryan put into this project, approximately 900 hours of invasive species removal (mostly Chinese Privet, Japanese Honeysuckle, and Wisteria) was accomplished here at Medoc Mountain State Park, other areas were identified for future work, not one injury was reported, partnerships were strengthened between the park and the Halifax County 4-H, Halifax County Convention and Visitors Bureau, and Sylvan Heights Waterfowl Park. Ryan also conducted two prescribed burns during the month of March, fulfilling his requirements for his North Carolina Burn Boss Certification.\r\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I believe that Park Ranger Ryan Newsome should be awarded the divisionâ€™s Special Achievement Award. \r\n','bill.d.meyer@ncparks.gov','252-586-6588','','MEMO','NODI','2015-03-30','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Meyer1154,Greenwood3841,Bash8938,Tillotson5212,Bash8938','','','uploads/2015/AN_053_other_file_1_1763.JPG','',''),(54,'AN_054','2015','','5','Nicole Crider and Joseph Hawley','On Saturday, March 21, GOCR Ranger Nicole Crider and GOCR Environmental Specialist Joseph Hawley saved a man\'s life.

For years Fort Fisher had had a major problem with non-native red foxes.  These foxes were destroying almost all bird nests and interfering with sea turtle nesting and predating a  majority of the nests.  A Fox Management Plan was created by Park Staff and the Operations Section in June 2008.  Everyone recognized the need to remove these predators.  The problem was implementing the plan.  We were to shoot on site when it was safe, and away from the public.  This is a very challenging thing to do and only resulted in a handful of foxes removed in the first several years.  Heavy predation continued.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of how bad it was is in 2012 19 out of 30 Sea Turtle nests were predated by fox, resulting in only a 57% successful hatch rate for the season.  The American Oystercatchers (Bird) had 15 nesting attempts in the season all were predated.  This was the standard.  No one on staff had seen an oystercatcher chick in over 10 years.  Basically you could go back from 2012 and hit the repeat button and you would have the same results as 2012. Something different had to be done.  So we began to look into trapping.  We looked at first to contract with APHIS, a private company that does removal projects.  We were not excited about how they wanted to hide it from the public and simply the cost, as it was going to be several thousand dollars.  \r\n\r\nWhen I spoke with Ranger Kip Futch at Carolina Beach he said he would like to try.  For weeks we scouted the area looking for signs and dens.  In December of 2012 Ranger Futch placed traps in the dunes at Fort Fisher.  For a 10 day period he would come in at 6AM to check the traps, and place new ones or move existing ones, all of which is time consuming. During that 10 day stretch Ranger Futch removed 15 red foxes and 2 coyotes from the park! In May of 2013 he removed 5 foxes and in December of 2013 3 foxes were removed. In May of 2014 3 coyotes were removed, and in December 2014 4 foxes and 2 coyotes were removed.  In all Ranger Kip has trapped and euthanized 27 red foxes and 7 coyotes since he started.\r\n\r\nSo what has been the benefit? In the summer of 2013 after the first major round of trapping Fort Fisher had 52 sea turtle nests laid.  First it was the most we had ever had.  Secondly only 1 nest was predated!  The hatch success rate was over 86%! The first oystercatcher chicks in 10 years were seen!  In 2014 we had 18 sea turtle nests with no predation.  Hatch success rate was at 87%!   At least 40 least tern (bird) nests were spotted.  No one on staff had seen those before. So far in 2015 we have 55 sea turtle nests with no predation! (another record).  Staff have found and numbered over 170 least tern nests!  We have had to rope off areas of the beach due to so many which is great!  Finally we have banded 3 oystercatcher chicks and we\'re banding more next week!\r\n\r\nRanger Futch did most all of this work on his own.  All the equipment he uses is his own personal equipment, and it has been no additional cost to the state.  The numbers above don\'t lie.  Kip has gone above and beyond to turn the resource management program at Fort Fisher around.  He has graciously offered to continue these efforts for years to come.  Without him I am 100% certain we not have oystercatcher chicks, least tern nests and chicks, and great hatch rates for sea turtles without his efforts!  This is why Ranger Kip Futch deserves and has earned a Special Achievement Award. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','jeffrey.owen@ncparks.gov','910 458-5798','','FOFI','SODI','2015-07-06','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Owen0623,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Bash8938','','','','',''),(57,'AN_057','2015','','2','Susan Campbell','Susan has worked part time with Weymouth for 15 years.

I, Kristen Woodruff, and Stevie Tatum responded immediately.  We left the park office with an AED and headed to Camp Clearwaterâ€™s pier (87A in park files).\r\n	Upon arrival, approximately 5 minutes later, I observed law enforcement and medical responder vehicles parked at the arcade, adjacent to the pier.  We ran out onto the pier and observed White Lake Fire Dept. staff performing CPR on the child victim, later identified as 4 year old.  I ran the short distance back to the vehicle to get the AED because I did not see one on hand at that time.  Stevie Tatum and another member of the White Lake FD began to start the AED and the ambulance was arriving simultaneously to the arcade area.  White Lake FD staff lifted the child up off the pier on the backboard and yelled that they were taking him to the ambulance.  The AED had not been used at this time.  Staff secured the AED and we followed to the ambulance with the victim.  EMS resumed control of the patient and assessments.  \r\n	Stevie Tatum continued to assist EMS in the back of the ambulance with CPR while I spoke with surrounding first responders to attempt to locate the guardian of the small child.  Someone yelled that there was another child missing and unaccounted for.  At this time, I ran back towards the swim beach and was informed that heâ€™d been located.  I called DISU Jay Greenwood and informed him of the event and proceeded back to the ambulance for assistance.  I took over CPR for Stevie Tatum and performed chest compressions while EMS continued to deliver patient care and we left for the hospital in Elizabethtown.

Dispatchers further advised that the subject was believed to be heading toward Morrow Mountain with the intention of		\r\ncommitting suicide. At 13:37 I received that call and spoke with the Cabarrus County Sheriff\'s Office.	\r\nToday the subject  had told his wife that he was going someplace \"about an hour away\" to kill himself.	The wife surmised that he would\r\nbe heading to MOMO as this is where they had married.	 I radioed all MOMO personnel giving a description of  the subjects vehicle, advising of his possible	suicidal intent.\r\nThe sheriffâ€™s office advised that he was pinging the subjects cellular phone and that he had traveled southward on\r\nHighway 52 and then turned left onto Highway 740, bolstering the theory that  The subject was driving to\r\nMOMO.	I asked if the subject  was armed and was told that he was almost assuredly armed, that he\r\nwas a gun enthusiast with many firearms; and that he held a NC concealed weapons permit.	I radioed\r\nthat information to Rangers Anundson and Jason Murvine, the other two commissioned officers		\r\nassigned to MOMO on this day.	It was a warm, sunny spring day and I knew that all parking lots in\r\nthe park would be at or near capacity with hikers, picnickers, and sight seers.	From experience, I\r\nknew that most persons that threaten or commit suicide at MOMO do it at the summit picnic area.	I\r\nthen radioed Anundson and Murvine	that I was proceeding to the front gate of the park in an		\r\nattempt to stop The subject before he could get to the crowded areas of the park.	I asked Murvine to\r\ngo to the summit picnic area to ascertain if the subject  had already arrived in that location.	To		\r\nexpedite my drive from the Kron House area to the front gate, I activated my warning lights and		\r\nflashers as I traveled along the main park road.	I noted that there was a steady stream of traffic\r\nalong the park roadways.	I had just passed the Y intersection when I passed a gray Jeep Cherokee\r\nmatching the description of the subjects  automobile traveling toward the interior of the park.	\r\nI did a three point road turn and 	headed toward the summit of Morrow Mountain.	Several hundred yards past the Y intersection I came upon Jason Murvine who was operating a marked, full-sized pickup truck with the emergency warning lights\r\nactivated.	Murvine was following the gray Jeep Cherokee. 	I then activated my siren and using my VHF radio advised		\r\nMurvine that I was right behind him.	I radioed Stanly County		\r\ndispatchers and advised that we were following on the main park road to the summit and that\r\nthe driver was not yielding to blue lights and sirens.	The dispatcher advised me that the subject  had\r\nindicated that \"he would not be taken alive\".	I transmitted this		\r\ninformation to staff.	The subject  was operating his vehicle at speeds slightly above		\r\nthe posted 25 MPH limit, but not at excessive speed.	When\r\nit became readily apparent that the subject  was not going to stop, Murvine pulled his vehicle into the\r\nleft lane and passed The subject.	Once past The subject, Murvine positioned his vehicle straddling the		\r\nyellow line and began to slow down, responding left and right as The subject attempted to drive around\r\nhim.	We had slowed to approximately 10 MPH when  The subject drove his vehicle hard to the left and		\r\naccelerated rapidly.	 The subject drove onto the scant left shoulder of the roadway and was successful\r\nin passing Murvine.	Murvine and I continued to pursue the subject   toward the summit picnic area with  Speed reaching approximately 35 MPH.	Upon entering the summit area parking lot, I noted that\r\nalmost every parking space was full of automobiles and motorcycles and there were numerous people\r\nin the area of the parking lot and picnic area.	The subject traveled through the parking lot, toward\r\nthe traffic circle at the end of the parking lot.	I radioed to Murvine \"Let\'s		\r\nblock him in the circle.\"	When we arrived at the circle,  The subject turned to the right in a counter\r\nclockwise direction. Murvine turned left, entering the circle in a clockwise direction and blocking\r\n The subject\'s forward progress.	I turned to the right and stopped approximately 20 feet from the rear\r\nof The subject\'s vehicle.	Upon stopping, Murvine exited his vehicle, drew his service weapon and moved\r\nquickly toward the driver\'s side door of The subject\'s vehicle.	Murvine was demanding: \"Let me see		\r\nyour hands.	\"	I place my vehicle in park, exited my vehicle, drew my service weapon and yelled:		\r\n\"Let me see your hands\" at least twice.	I could not see  The subject due to window tinting and the		\r\nangle at which I was trying to peer through the windows of the Cherokee.	As Murvine was quickly		\r\napproaching the driver\'s side door, I moved to the front of my truck and began crossing between my\r\nvehicle and The subject\'s, keeping my weapon pointed at the driver\'s compartment of the car.	My		\r\nintention was to move to the passenger side of the vehicle where I could hopefully see into the		\r\ninterior of the car and cover The subject.	As Murvine moved to the driver\'s side window, I heard him\r\nsay:	\"He\'s got a gun.\"	I saw the driver\'s side door of the Jeep Cherokee open and Murvine moving\r\ninto the V formed between the interior of the door and the main body of the vehicle.	I then heard\r\nI\r\na loud bang which I immediately recognized as a gunshot.\r\nThe Jeep Cherokee then began to move forward.	Murvine reached into the vehicle and \r\nplaced the vehicle in park, his actions stopping the forward movement of\r\nthe vehicle.	Murvine then backed out of the door.	Not knowing whom, if anyone had been shot.	I\r\nmoved quickly to the driver\'s side door where I discovered the body of The subject,		\r\nseat-belted into the driver\'s seat of the automobile.		I checked for a radial pulse and found none.	I went to my pickup		\r\ntruck and retrieved my medical response kit.	as I\r\nwatched I could see The subject\'s Adam\'s Apple moving up and down and surmised that he was swallowing\r\nI could also hear breath sounds coming from the subject\'s neck.		I asked EMS to assist me in removing The subject from the vehicle and placing him on		\r\nthe ground on his side in the recovery position, hoping that would him to breathe easier.	I reached into the vehicle and disengaged\r\nThe subject\'s seat belt and Butler and I succeeded in placing the subject on the ground and in the recovery\r\nposition.	This seemed to ease the subject\'s breathing and his skin lost the blue pallor, but he was		\r\nlosing blood.	I attempted to staunch some of the blood loss with weak direct		\r\npressure and a bandage, but could not effectively control bleeding as the wound was all around the\r\ntrachea. Shortly thereafter East Side Volunteer Fire Department arrived on		\r\nscene and took over care for the patient.		While		\r\nemptying The subject\'s pockets,	I located two speed loaders, each loaded with six rounds of what		\r\nappears to be .357 caliber ammunition.	In another pocket I located a speed strip loaded with six		\r\nrounds of what appears to be .357 caliber ammunition.	\r\n	\r\n\r\n			\r\n','jay.greenwood@ncparks.gov','9198414058','','MOMO','SODI','2015-07-24','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Bash8938','','','','',''),(60,'AN_060','2015','','4','Greg Schneider & Jason Murvine','I, Park Ranger Jason Murvine on 4/12/2015 at around 1:30pm (not sure of exact time), was advised by park superintendent Greg Schneider that a call was received from another countyâ€™s sheriffs department.  Greg advised we were to be on the look out(BOLO) for a silver jeep Cherokee with North Carolina plate CJP-5911.  A white male was supposed to be driving the jeep and he was headed to Morrow Mountain to commit suicide.  It was also mentioned that the driver would likely be armed and possessed a concealed carry permit.\r\n\r\nI was at the visitorâ€™s center with Ranger Ron Anunson when I was advised of the BOLO.  Ron called the county to get more information on the potential suicidal male and I was in communication with Greg by radio.  Greg advised me that he was going to the front gate to try and stop the man before he entered the park and that I should go to the top of the mountain to look for the jeep.  Ron stayed at the visitorâ€™s center trying to obtain more information.\r\n\r\nAs I left the visitorâ€™s center in my ranger truck I saw Greg in his ranger truck and he had activated his blue lights.  I activated my blue lights at that time and headed toward the top of Morrow Mountain.  When I got to the fork in the road and kept left to head to the top of the mountain, the jeep that we were looking for drove past and was heading toward the top of the mountain.  At first I didnâ€™t not recognize the vehicle as the one described in the BOLO.  I followed the vehicle approximately a quarter mile with my blue lights on.  Then Greg called me on the radio and said he was behind me.  The jeep was not pulling over to the side to let me pass, which I thought was strange.  Greg then turned his siren on and I noticed the NC plate matched the one given in the BOLO.  I then activated my siren.  The jeep continued to drive to the top of the mountain at a rate likely greater than 25mph but not excessively fast that I noticed.\r\n\r\nWhen the jeep would not pull over I decide to go around him so we could box him in.  I went around him on the left, no on coming traffic was present, and got in front of him.  Once I got in front of the jeep I slowed my vehicle considerably in an attempt to stop the jeep.  I was driving my vehicle in the middle of the road so the jeep could not pass me and Greg was still behind the jeep.  I thought we could prevent him from reaching the top and stop him from committing suicide.\r\n\r\nAfter pulling in front of the jeep, within 20-30 second the driver of the jeep went left of my ranger truck and passed me.  The jeep was part on the road and part off the road.  No on coming traffic at that point.  We are not authorized to pit vehicles or crash them in an attempt to stop them.  When the jeep passed me he increased his speed significantly.  I tried to get back around him but could not safely.  The driver kept swerving when I would attempt to pass.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the switch back, the driver of the jeep cut the corner sharp and slung gravel from his tires.   Once we passed the switchback I could see the driver had a cell phone up to his right ear.  After the switchback turn, there was oncoming traffic present and I felt it was not longer safe to try and get around the jeep.\r\nOnce we arrived at the top of the mountain, the jeep drove at a normal speed past the bathroom and entered the round about at the end of the parking lot.   The jeep went to the right and went to the left in the round about.  I parked my vehicle at an angle so he could not come back out.  Greg drove his vehicle behind the jeep in the round about so he couldnâ€™t back out.  There were no other vehicles in the round about and no bystanders.\r\n\r\nI opened the driverâ€™s door of my truck, blue lights and sirens engaged and the truck still running.  The truck was in park.  I went around my driverâ€™s door and drew my firearm and pointed it at the driver.  I was giving the driver commands, saying â€œShow me your handsâ€ and â€œGet out of the vehicleâ€.  I was approaching the jeep from the front drivers side and Greg was approaching from the rear driverâ€™s side.  I noticed Greg had his weapon drawn also.  \r\n\r\n The jeep had tinted windows and as I got closer to the vehicle I noticed the driver had a gun pointed under his chin toward the top of his head.  I yelled to Greg that the driver had a gun and it was pointed at his chin so he was aware.  \r\n\r\nI was trying to approach the driverâ€™s door and when I reached it I holstered my firearm and opened the door with my left hand.  The driverâ€™s door was unlocked. The jeep was still running, it wasnâ€™t moving so it must have been in park.  Greg had not quit gotten to jeep at this point and no bystanders were present.  \r\n\r\nAs I opened to the door, I started to reach to grab the gun.  As I was reaching the driver said â€œgood byâ€ and fired a single shot.  The driver had both hands on the gun, which was a dark colored revolver.  I did not fire a shot during the incident.\r\n\r\nAfter the shot the driver fell back in his seat and both arms dropped down.  There was a substantial amount of blood running down his shirt and pants.  The bottom park of the drivers jaw was missing and it appeared that his esophagus or trachea was visible.  At this point I was looking for the gun and Greg was asking â€œwhere is the gun?â€.  I could not see the gun from the drivers side so I walked around and opened the passenger side front door.  I saw the gun logged between the drivers seat and the center console.  The gun appeared to have a wooden handle and was a revolver.\r\n\r\nAt this point Greg was at the drivers side door and he told me not to worry about touching the gun,  the driver was no longer a threat.  I noticed pieces of bone on the passenger side dash and on the carpet near the passenger side front door.\r\n\r\nI then walked back to the driverâ€™s side of the jeep and Greg was calling EMS.  I noticed the driverâ€™s chest was still rising and falling, so he was still breathing.  The driver never made any noises.  I was not going to pull the driver out of the vehicle because I did not want to make the problem any worse.\r\n\r\nI then returned to my truck and turned it off, along with the siren.  Greg said that we needed to get witness information.  At some point Ranger Ron Anunson and a Badin police officer arrived at the top.  I told Ron to get information from specific people who would have seen the incident.  Ron collected information from 5 different people.\r\n\r\nWhile Ron collected information, I began to walk through the picnic area requesting for people to leave, as we needed to close the mountain.  I noticed one individual who was taking his time leaving and was taking a video using his phone.  After clearing out the bystanders I began taping off the crime scene to keep people out.  While I was taping off the crime scene the ambulance arrived.  I left the road open until all the emergency vehicles had left the round about.\r\n\r\nThe Badin police officer asked for my keys as I was clearing the mountain and he moved my truck outside of the crime scene so that the ambulance could get in.  Only one ambulance arrived, but numerous Volunteer fire members arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\nAfter clearing bystanders out of the area I returned to see the driver of the jeep had been removed from the vehicle and EMS was working on him to try and stabilize him.  Greg and the Badin police officer advised me that they had pulled him out of the jeep and put him in the recover position so that fluid could run out of his lungs and allow him to breath.  They advised that his skin color had started to turn blue as he was sitting upright in the jeep.\r\n\r\nWe kept the scene secure until other law enforcement agencies arrived and Greg advised the chain of command of the incident.\r\n\r\nI cleared the scene at 21:30 hours.\r\n','jason.murvine@ncparks.gov','330-714-7249','','MOMO','SODI','2015-07-25','','','','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Murvine6406,Tillotson5212,Bash8938','','','','',''),(61,'AN_061','2015','','2','Cristical Incident Stress Debriefing Team- Angelia Allcox, Peter Mitchell, Jane Conolly, Kelly King, Lee Amos, John Shell, Karen Johnson','Team members have volunteered to take on this additional duty to help their fellow staff members through tragedies that take place in our parks.

By the fall of 2006, its presence was confirmed from the Dumont Road access all the way to Guess Road â€“ nearly 14 miles, the entire length of the park.   Hydrilla is a major threat to the ecology and the recreational aspects of waterways and it rapidly clogged up the Eno River.  Canoeing, fishing, and swimming became difficult and unpleasant.  There was great concern for the effect on native plant life depended on by both rare and common aquatic creatures and for waterfowl due to the potential of disease associated with the Hydrilla.  The NC Wildlife Resources Commission had to end their Roanoke Bass study as the Hydrilla interfered with their ability to inventory.\\r\\nPark and Natural Resource Management section staff sought answers through other state agencies, but the difficulty of controlling Hydrilla in an open flowing environment stymied everyone.  For years, no traction was gained on control and the problem worsened.\\r\\nKeith Nealson inherited and began working on this problem when he became Eno River State Park Superintendent in 2008.  One of the greatest hurdles to Hydrilla management, beyond the technical difficulties, was the large number of stakeholders on the river.  There was a mixture of local, state, and federal agencies, who all recognized and wanted to solve the problem, but no-one stepped forward to take charge or even knew who should take charge of finding a solution.  This is when Keith stepped in and became the catalyst for organizing the Eno River Hydrilla Task Force.\\r\\nKeith became the driving force of keeping the issue in front of the agencies, authorities, and sections who needed to be involved to collectively succeed at finding and implementing a solution.  He sought out and motivated those that needed to be involved, followed through on the efforts needed, and provided the communications to this disparate group.  He pulled the appropriate agencies together to meet face to face and in 2012 the task force first met with representatives from DPR, NC DWR, NC WRC, NC NHP, US Fish and Wildlife Service, NCSU, The Town of Hillsborough Public Utilities, the City of Raleigh Public Utilities, Orange-Alamance Water Systems, USACE-Falls Lake, NCDA&CS Noxious Weed Program, and the Eno River Association.  Since then the task force has grown to add Durham and Wake Counties and 45 people.  For the next couple of years Keith provided the leadership at the meetings of the task force before turning it over to the DPR Natural Resources Section.\\r\\nThe task force has been a team effort as has all the experimentation and the eventual control plan and implementation.  But someone had to shepherd it, and that was Keith Nealson.  He has been personally involved with all the surveys of the problem, getting the scientists to where they need to go, helping everyone find the plants and animals that need to be monitored and experimented on, guided the logistics for experimentation, and making sure all the key task force members stayed informed.   Keith personally led and organized the experiment to try hand pulling the Hydrilla with over 300 hours of work with volunteers.  He was the key person for community information, relations, and education until an educational subcommittee was formed in 2014 and then he continued in an active role on that sub-committee.  The educational efforts were critical to success as the approach narrowed to putting herbicide in the river that served as both drinking water and recreational waters for hundreds of thousands of people.\\r\\nIn 2015 the task force implemented its Hydrilla management strategy of releasing low doses of fluridone.  Keith found them a location in the up-river reaches of the park where they had required access but was remote enough that there was little chance of public interference.  Originally the plan was for DWR Aquatic Weed Control Program staff to manage the mechanics of the pumping equipment but they were unable and Keith and the park staff stepped up and have been at a minimum weekly taking care of and monitoring the equipment.  The fluridone has had a remarkable effect on knocking down the Hydrilla.  When concerns rose as to the effect the fluridone was having a native vegetation Keith both monitored and reported the concerns, leading to adjustments in the plan.\\r\\nThe Eno River Hydrilla Task Force would not have been successful without all of the team members.  But in any organization there has to be someone who is passionate and committed to the cause and has the leadership skills to make things happen.  Keith Nealson was that person, being a stalwart through pessimism, obstacles, and government bureaucracy.  He did this during a time when his park staff was severely reduced and park operations significantly increased.  He learned the names and roles of everyone on the task force and developed a good working relationship with each one. He remained positive and persevered and deserves recognition of a DPR special achievement award. \\r\\n','dave.cook@ncparks.gov','(919)841-4059','','NODI','NODI','2015-08-03','','','','','Yes','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Cook4712,Tillotson5212,Bash8938','','','','',''),(72,'AN_072','2015','','5','Scott Avis and David Mumford','On 10-11-14 Scott Avis and David Mumford responded to an unresponsive woman at the Beaverdam boat ramp.

The Weed Action Coalition of the Hickory Nut Gorge (WAC-HNG) is one of those rare entities in the world of stewardship where a cooperative public-private initiative has consistently exceeded expectations and has yielded meaningful and lasting results on a landscape scale.  The 66,000 acre watershed that is WAC-HNGâ€™s focus encompasses the Hickory Nut Gorge around Lake Lure and is notable for protecting over 50 rare species in some of North Carolinaâ€™s highest quality habitats.  \\r\\nWAC-HNG was initiated in 2010 following the recognition by the Friends of the Hickory Nut Gorge that invasive species constituted a major threat to the gorgeâ€™s recreational, ecological, scenic, and economic values.  The mission statement is simple:  To identify, remove, and prevent the future proliferation of non-native invasive species in the Hickory Nut Gorge watershed in order to preserve its biological diversity, health, and scenic beauty.  \\r\\nFunded by a series of grants and powered by an unusually diverse and active coalition of over a dozen local, state, federal, and private civic, conservation, and land stewardship agencies, the coalition hired a coordinator in 2012, and by 2013 a 5-year strategic plan was in place.  \\r\\nWith a strong emphasis on inventory and monitoring, invasive species treatments, and public education and outreach, the coalition has leveraged cooperation between all of the partners and a wide array of volunteers in order to significantly expand the capacity for invasive species management on a landscape scale on both public and private lands.  To date, the coalition has inventoried and mapped invasive species on over 3,200 acres, it has treated nearly 500 acres, and it has produced over a dozen site management plans for public and private land holders.  Public exposure through multiple media sources has been consistently positive, and it is clear that WAC-HNG has raised stewardship awareness and action to levels never previously seen on this landscape.  \\r\\nWAC-HNGâ€™s work at Chimney Rock State Park has been a model of success that is unmatched across the state park system.  Since 2013, WAC-HNG has spent over $40,000 and devoted over 1,000 hours of labor while treating over 200 acres of state park property.  Highlights include inventorying and mapping park property, developing treatment protocols, hiring work crews from the American Conservation Experience, coordinating volunteers, and providing all of the herbicides.  In 2015, WAC-HNG contracted with the park, Chimney Rock LLC, and the Friends of the Hickory Nut Gorge to use goats to begin treatment on the parkâ€™s extensive kudzu infestations.  The use of goats is a landmark advance in invasive species management at the park and would likely have been impossible without WAC-HNGâ€™s involvement.  \\r\\nWAC-HNG consists of only three employees, all of whom work tirelessly with homeowners, businesses, private and public land owners, and volunteers in order to advance the cause of stewardship, regardless of ownership.  The skill and devotion of this organization, and particularly its value to stewardship on state park properties, cannot be overstated.  Without WAC-HNGâ€™s support, invasive species management at Chimney Rock State Park would have been immensely more difficult and almost certainly less successful.  \\r\\n\\r\\nContact Debbie Shetterly (828)-625-9983 EXT 506 \\r\\n','matthew.haynes@ncparks.gov','828-625-1823','','CHRO','WEDI','2015-08-15','','','','','No','Yes','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Haynes2868,Haynes2868,Tillotson5212,Bash8938','','','','uploads/2015/AN_078_other_file_3_9792.docx',''),(79,'AN_079','2015','','2','Bob Martin','Bob Martin, a seasonal GUW at CRMO, was recently required to go above and beyond the scope of his normal duties and performed admirably.

Both Ranger staff on the park were tied up with a domestic dispute on the summit of Crowders Mountain (four miles away as a crow flies).  Ranger Dan Tenney determined that Bob, who had been trained in Gator use, could drive the Gator as far as possible up the Pinnacle trail, then hike up and locate the injured party.  Bob did this, having to hike a steep .5 mile trail on a hot, humid day.  Once Bob arrived he, with the assistance of bystanders, was able to bring the victim safely to the Gator, and drive the Gator out to an awaiting Ranger and mother of the victim.  Bob handled the victim so professionally and with such care that, although the victim had probably broken her ankle, she was still smiling and laughing as she reached the end of her Gator trip.rnrnBob Martin exemplifies the spirit of NC State Parks seasonal staff; poorly paid, given difficult hours, but willingly assisting permanent staff in areas that go above and beyond their normal daily duties.

Stephen led CHRO ranger staff in taking ownership of the parkâ€™s educational programs, and rather than hurt the concessionaireâ€™s bottom line, visitation increased and seeds were sown for future visits to and support and conservation of state parks.rnAs a result, Ranger Stephen Tillotsonâ€™s exemplary performance of his duties as CHROâ€™s lead I&E ranger have made him a tremendous asset to the park and the education of future state parks supporters. Well aware that he could not do it alone, he forged new relationships with the parkâ€™s concessionaire, educators in four counties, and partners in recreation and conservation in order to reach increasingly large numbers of people and share with them the parkâ€™s natural wonders. Stephenâ€™s tact, encouragement, and leadership paved the way for the rest of the parkâ€™s I&E staff to follow, and he did this all in addition to his role as the parkâ€™s lead law enforcement ranger. Ripples from his positive efforts will rebound back to the park and the Division in years to come, and so we at CHRO highly recommend Stephen for the Thomas C. Ellis Award.rnrn','james.ledgerwood@ncparks.gov','828-625-1823','','CHRO','WEDI','2015-09-04','','','','','No','Abstain','','','','','','0000-00-00','','Ledgerwood8022,Tillotson5212,Bash8938,Bash8938','','','','',''),(81,'AN_081','2015','','3','Dewey Matherly','Dewey Matherly is a long time volunteer at CRMO.

They lead volunteer trail and park work days, provide significant monetary support to the annual Old Fashioned Days, volunteer at every MOMO event, have provided a $500.00 scholarship to Ranger Murvine for attend a class concerning the making of native bows and arrows,and are the voice of the park in the local community.  But in the last two years they have tackled an enormous maintenance and beautification project which EVERY visitor to Morrow Mountain State Park views and appreciates.  Their effort have rebuilt the iconic stone wall at the entrance to Morrow Mountain State Park, saving the state $40,000.00 in the process. In this project, the Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park have brought together park staff, volunteers, multiple commercial donors, multiple individual donors, grants from Friends of State Parks, skilled craftsmen, and others to re-build two beautiful walls that perfectly frame the entrance to the park.  rnrnThe President of the Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park is Vanessa Mullinix and she has been the driving force behind the wall project.  She lives at 44588 Morrow Mountain Road, Albemarle, NC 28001 and she can be reached at (704) 983-8941. rnrnThe following account of the building of the MOMO entrance wall was written by active Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park member John Young:  rnrnFriends of Morrow Mountain State Park Wall Restoration ProjectrnrnAt meetings of Friends of Morrow Mt. State Park in late 2013 and early 2014 a number of members suggested that an ideal project for our relatively new group to tackle would be to restore the two front entrance walls.  The Civilian Conservation Corps had built those walls with dry stacked argillite stone in 1940.  The stone used at the front walls, like most all of the stone used throughout the park, were cut from argillite quarries from inside the park.rnThe original dry stacked walls had been reworked a couple of times since 1940 and some of those efforts were not up to the quality of the original CCC work.  One story has it that as the walls deteriorated someone attempted to drive over some weaker sections with a four wheel drive vehicle.  FMMSP members wanted the walls to be restored as closely as possible to the original look of dry stacked stones but also to use some newer techniques that would ensure that the walls lasted for many years.rnIn early June of 2014 the north side wall (on you left as you enter the park) restoration project began.  Volunteer labor provided by members of FMMSP, some in the community and some volunteers from the Robin Sage, Army Special Forces Qualification Program, helped take down the old argillite stone and set them to the side for the stone masons to use later.  Significant in-kind labor was donated to dig the footing for the wall and to spread the concrete.  Deanâ€™s Ready Mixed, Inc. and Pate Masonry Supply, LLC provided the concrete, sand, mortar, block, etc. at a discount for the project.  Then Rocky Parker of Rocky Parker Masonry, who also discounted his charges, began a month long project to rebuild the north wall.rnIn mid-August volunteers again did a lot of landscaping around the wall, and the extra argillite stones were moved and stored for use on future projects.  Then in late August, under the guidance of FMMSP Director, Walter Deppe all the volunteers listed above helped split, and build the cedar rail fence along the north side entrance to replace the dilapidated, old cedar rail fence.rnThis north side wall project cost $9,548.00 but when we give value to the many volunteer hours of hard work, in-kind contributions and discounts given we estimate the value of the north side project to be over $14,000.00.  The payments of $9,548.00 were made possible from our largest gift, a grant from Friends of State Parks of $3,000.00 and then major gifts from Fiberon Decking in New London and Bank of North Carolina as well as hundreds of smaller gifts from members and the community.rnThe entire process almost repeated itself starting in late June of 2015.  Once again volunteers from FMMSP and the community gathered to take down the stones on the much longer south side wall and set them to the side for Rocky Parker, the stone mason.  rnSteve Austin Landscaping contributed his labor and equipment to dig out and remove several large stumps, dig the footing and handle the concrete.  Again at a discount Deanâ€™s Ready Mix and Pate Masonry Supply provided the concrete, block, mortar, sand, etc.  Then during July and August Rocky Parker of Rocky Parker Masonry at a discount rebuilt the south wall.  In early September some initial clean-up around the wall has taken place.  The extra argillite stones are once again being removed and stored for future use.  Some significant landscape work is still needed as well as the installation of a cedar rail fence at the back of the wall so we probably have at least another $1,000.00 in plants, mulch and value assigned volunteer labor for later in September or October.rnThe south side wall project cost (note right above it is not yet finished) $16,824.00 and when we give value to the many volunteer hours, in-kind contributions and discounts given we estimate the value of the south side project to be around $23,000.00.  The payments of $16,824.00 were made possible again from our largest gift, a grant of initially $3,000, then another $2,000, for a total of $5,000.00 from Friends of State Parks.  The next largest gift was given by Culp Lumber followed by a gift from Bank of Stanly as well as hundreds of smaller gifts from members and the community.rnOur estimate is that Friends of Morrow Mountain State Park has with direct money, volunteer labor, in-kind contributions and discounts from contractors created a fully restored front entrance on both the north and south sides that has a value of over $37,000.00.   All during the project on both walls it was FMMSP Board Chairman, Vanessa Mullinix, who organized the volunteer labor, contacted the contractors and directly raised most of the major gifts.  Her efforts were extraordinary.  The efforts involved many folks but the greatest thanks must go to the Friends of State Parks and their grants totaling $8,000.00 that made this wall restoration project a reality.rnrnrnThis summary of the wall restoration project was prepared by John D.

Chanda quickly developed a process for managing the entries and was able to keep up with over 2,000 photos for each contest.  She knows that people want a quick response to their entry and she worked hard to keep up with them.  She never allowed this additional work to delay any of her other deadlines or projects.rnrnChandaâ€™s computer skills are a marvel to those of us who are technologically challenged, but her personal skills and her desire to always make a positive experience for someone else makes her one of a kind.rnrnNot only does she keep up with all of the photos and the technical aspects of the task, but she gets to know the contestants individually.  When Chanda saw that a little girl had taken the initiate to make sea turtle tracks in the sand because she could not find any actual tracks for her photo, Chanda knew that she wanted to do something special for the girl.  The girl got a bandana for her efforts and Chanda remembers her name, to this day.  Another familyâ€™s adventure into NC State Parks began with the first Scavenger Hunt: they submitted entries for nine parks.  Their daughter then went on to earn 11 Junior Ranger patches and discovered TRACK Trails along the way.  This eight year old is now participating in a community service project at Lake James State Park.  I have to believe that Chandaâ€™s positive attitude and competent organization of the scavenger hunt had an influence on the familyâ€™s desire to pursue these opportunities.  A colleague has said that she is happy that Chanda is the â€˜face of the Scavenger Huntâ€™ because she is such a positive representation of state parks.  I couldnâ€™t agree more.rnrnTo keep the Scavenger hunt â€˜aliveâ€™ for all park staff, Chanda sent out some of the best photos so that we could all enjoy them and know that we were each an active part of the event.  A goal she has for future Scavenger Hunts is to make all the photos available on line for everyone to enjoy.rnrnBecause she cares about the event and wants to see it draw more people in to enjoy our state parks, she has provided Sean Higgins and Denise Williams with an evaluation of the project and recommendations for future Scavenger Hunts.  rnrnChanda has gone above and beyond what was expected of her and has actively contributed to the success of the Scavenger Hunt.  As in all her contact with the public, Chanda is genuinely delighted when she is able to provide information or services that make people happy.  This, combined with her technical skills makes her an outstanding ambassador for NC State Parks!rn','sean.mcelhone@ncparks.gov','704-528-6514','','WEDI','WEDI','2016-05-19','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','','0000-00-00','','McElhone8290,Bash8938,Tillotson5212,Greenwood3841,Gallagher9613','','','','',''),(85,'AN_085','2016','Nomination Received by Awards Committee','5','Rangers Andrew Boos and Michael Walker','Ranger Boos overheard someone yelling for help and activated response to help drowning person.

These four leaders have spearheaded a massive rehabilitation effort at Falls Lake State Recreation Area involving both Operating Budget and Major Maintenance Funds that resulted in extensive financial savings in our energy budget, increased efficiency in water usage, and increased visitor satisfaction.rnrnMr. Barbour, while maintaining responsibility for infrastructure, building, and grounds maintenance of a highly popular, 162 site Campground, led the planning and execution of the installation of high efficiency tankless water heaters throughout Falls Lake State Recreation Area.  He personally installed seven heaters in five buildings in Hollypoint Campground.  Due to his innovative design, use of modern technology, and extensive knowledge of electrical and plumbing systems, standardization of installation throughout the entire Falls Lake Recreation Area shower house system was achieved.  This has resulted in ten out of twelve shower houses converted in less than a yearâ€™s time with the last two scheduled to be completed in the next year.    This modernization effort, due in large part to his analysis of past and present energy and water use, has shown a 10-20 per cent decrease in both energy costs and water consumption.  In keeping with the mission of the State Park system, the move from electrical to clean gas power demonstrates his commitment to environmental concerns. rn rnMr. Grimes, who is leaned on for advise in many areas of concern to Park Maintenance staff, led an effort to update our thirty year old bathroom buildings.  Mr. Grimes is responsible for a large multi-use facility including a highly visited day use area, a 117 site family campground, a four site group campground, and a very highly popular community building.  His shower curtain and tiling ideas and execution have brought many favorable responses from campground visitors.  He designed the plan for tiling that will be used in all shower houses throughout the Park camping areas.  This has led to decreased time spent scrubbing concrete block walls in the showers with more efficient cleaning of the tile surface.  In addition to his ingenuity with the tiling project, done completely within Park operating budget, he has been a leader in the Parkâ€™s conversion to LED lighting.  This new lighting plan allows for less maintenance time, longer bulb lifetime, increased visibility in shower house and parking areas, and savings in our energy budget. Additionally, through his innovation we have decreased chemical use in cleaning our bathroom facilities, decreased energy use, and increased visitor satisfaction in keeping with the Divisionâ€™s mission.rnrnMr. Parkerâ€™s demonstrated commitment to Falls Lake is evident from the lack of downtime on our small engine equipment inventory.  Falls Lake does not have a small engine mechanic and he has gladly taken on this invaluable job as a collateral duty.  In addition to being responsible for an eleven site group campground and a multi-use campground with seven groups sites and 47 hike in sites, he manages an inventory of 13 riding lawnmowers, 40 weedeaters, blowers, and edgers, and a multitude of chainsaws.  Mr. Parker is also the pump expert on our highly used pumper units utilized for over 600 acres of prescribed burns in the last year.  He also is responsible for the grounds maintenance of his designated campgrounds, the park office and maintenance area, and the Piedmont Regional Office located at the Yorkshire Building in Raleigh.  He is leaned on heavily as a training asset at the park and beyond.  He teaches annual CPR Refresher classes and is also a division chainsaw instructor.  At monthly staff meetings he is commonly called upon to conduct safety and operational training of park equipment.  Mr. Parkerâ€™s commitment to safety, training, and efficient use of operating budget shows his dedication to Division priorities and mission.rnrnMr. Husketh is responsible for three highly popular day use areas.  This includes 15 reservable picnic shelters, two boat ramps, two fishing piers and a large spillway/fishing area.  This area also includes an enormous amount of picnic pads which he has rehabilitated in an outstanding manner.  He reclaimed three very seldom used picnic areas in the Beaverdam Day Use Facility by replacing tables, grills, thinning out overgrown brush, and opening up overgrown trail areas.  These areas now have signage indicating their location and have grown very popular over the last year.  He has also led our efforts at standardization of bathroom facilities.  Realizing we still used many high flow fixtures in our bathrooms, he designed a plan and materials list to replace everything with low flow or waterless fixtures.  He set the standards throughout the park with commodes, low flow flush valves, waterless urinals and low flow aerated sink fixtures.  He completed interior renovations on 8 bathroom facilities over the last year, upgrading electrical systems, painting the interiors, replacing all the fixtures, and upgrading lighting with LED fixtures and bulbs.  Another 8 facilities are planned for completion in the next year.

The maintenance staff and rangers can\\\'t do it on top of their regular daily duties and that\\\'s why the state park relies so heavily on its seasonal grounds-keeping crew. rnrnFrom before the time the gates open until long after most visitors have left for home, seasonal workers are scouring the park; picking up litter, removing ashes from campsite and picnic grills, addressing overflowing trash and recycling bins, cleaning bathrooms and shower houses, grooming the beach sand, and mowing and weed-eating the road shoulders and lawns. rnrnAmong LAJA\\\'s dedicated six-person all-star team is Justin Allen. To say Justin is passionate about the park would be an understatement. Several years ago he studied YouTube videos on how to mow stripes into lawns. The grass behind the Paddy\\\'s Creek bathhouse has looked like a major league outfield ever since. When he\\\'s not riding a mower or strapped to a weed-eater, Justin works tirelessly on all of the other park chores. He\\\'s even been known to volunteer his services when he\\\'s not on the payroll. This is the reason I am nominating Justin for a Special Achievement Award. When we weren\\\'t able to hire Justin back as early as usual this past spring, due to seasonal funding constraints, Justin volunteered to mow the park for free for during the month of May, accumulating 92 volunteer hours. This was such a tremendous help as we were pressed to get our new campground ready to open along with getting the rest of the park ready for the busy season. LAJA would be at a loss without Justin and we hope to show our gratitude with this award. rnrn','nora.coffey@ncparks.gov','828-584-7728','','LAJA','WEDI','2016-10-11','','','Yes','','Yes','No','Yes','','','','No','0000-00-00','','McGrath9695,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Bash8938,Blanchard3795','','','','',''),(92,'AN_092','2016','Nomination Received by Awards Committee','2','Chandra Siler, CHRO and APC Chair','For taking on the responsibility of the First NC State Park Photo Scavenger Hunt Challenge as proposed by Sean Higgins, I & E.Sean was in need of someone in the division with the interest and skills to communicate, announce, and track a public challenge to state park visitors for photographs to be awarded prizes as they visited statewide parks and took interesting photos in compliance with the Scavenger Hunt photo guidelines and Chanda Siler was nominated by the APC and accepted this new challenge with professionalism and a genuine interest in the First NC State Park Photo Scavenger Hunt tracking, uploading photos, designing unique posters and sending frequent emails and links to follow. rnrnI nominate Chanda Siler, hands down because now we have an annual interesting event to offer park visitors that include children and adults.

Outdoor Nation connects millenials (generally ages 18-28) from across the country to promote the outdoors to their generation.  The NC team won a $1,000 grant to get more people outside and engaged in nature by offering prizes for capturing a dozen photos from a list that included an insect, weather and a selfie with a park employee.  A partnership between park staff and Friends of North Carolina State Parks volunteers were key to its success.rnrnSean HigginsrnInterpretation & Education Program Managerrnrn   ','denise.williams@ncparks.gov','919-707-9341','This is a repeat, already nominated at park GRMO level by Sue Mcbean','GRMO','WEDI','2016-10-11','','','','','Yes','No','Yes','','','','','0000-00-00','','Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Williams5894,Tillotson5212,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Bash8938','','','uploads/2016/AN_092_other_file_1_5487.docx','uploads/2016/AN_092_other_file_3_1802.pdf','uploads/2016/AN_092_other_file_4_9918.docx'),(93,'AN_093','2016','Nomination Received by Awards Committee','2','HARI Events Staff including, event coordinator, kitchen staff, and housekeeping staff','Kelly King would be the contact person.

The crew learned how to work with filming equipment and how to edit and prepare their data.  They learned how to capture action and movement on film, how to film people and landscapes and how to use light to their advantage.  The crew orchestrated a well-choreographed exchange of equipment across the state in order to capture important events in each park.  They often worked extra weekends or long hours and made personal sacrifices in order to participate in the film crew while impacting their own park operations as little as possible.  The end result is a memorable film representing each state park, documenting the condition and status of our state parks at the time of our Centennial Anniversary and something for which entire Division can be proud.rnrnList of Film Crew:rnBrian Bockhahn  (NODI DIES)rnNick Bowman  (PIMO)rnDave Cook (retired)rnSandra Fambrough (MEMO)rnMary Griffin  (HARO)rnJessica Phillips (WIUM)rnJamie Cameron (LAJA)rnEd Farr (retired)rnLynette Hicks  (STMO)rnAmanda Lasley (SOMO)rnKelly Safley (retired)rnAndy Sicard  (GRMO)rnBrittany Hurtado  (SODI DIES)rnJeff Davidson  (MOMO)rnKip Futch  (CSBE)rnNancy Williamson  (WEWO)rnMike Walker  (FALA)rnVanessa Fischer (GOCR)rnJoe Hawley (GOCR)rnChristy Maready  (PETT)rnRandy Newman  (FOMA)rnPaul Terry (FOMA)rnSharon Becker  (MORE DIES)rnCaAra Hadfield (left the division)rnRahima Rahi (Cara\\\'s intern)rnMartin Kane (left the division)rn','susan.mcbean@ncparks.gov / tracy.minton@ncparks.gov','828.963.9522 Sue','','GRMO','STWD','2016-10-14','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','Yes','0000-00-00','','McBean0615,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Blanchard3795','','','','',''),(95,'AN_095','2016','Nomination Received by Awards Committee','2','Jessica Phillips','Ranger Jessica Phillips, like many NC state park rangers, loved the DPR image database.  It allows rangers all over NC to capture and share the most amazing moments, wildlife and scenes from parks - the type of images only park staff are likely to capture by being up at sunrise and hiking dozens of miles of park boundary lines.  Jessica wanted to take it a step further by sharing with with North Carolina State Park visitors.  She initiated the I Spy with My Park Ranger Eye exhibit to do just that.rnrnJessica fully directed the initiative:  she wrote the initiative description and logistics, recruited help from fellow staff, and sold the idea to staff at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences.  With support of the Museum of Natural Sciences exhibit team, the top floor of the museum hosted the exhibit from November 2015 through February 2016.   During the first weekend of the exhibit, Jessica hosted a special event with two education booths allowing rangers to educate hundreds of museum goers, and Park Superintendent Joe Shimel leading programs in the Daily Planet theater.   The exhibits\\\' popularity encouraged museum staff to extend the exhibit a month beyond its original plan.  rnrnAfter the success at the Museum of Natural Sciences, the I Spy photos were used by exhibit staff and showcased at Fort Macon and New River\\\'s Centennial events.  rnrn','sean.higgins@ncparks.gov','919-805-2194','','INED','STWD','2016-10-17','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','Yes','0000-00-00','','Higgins6125,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Bash8938,Blanchard3795','','','','',''),(96,'AN_096','2016','Nomination Received by Awards Committee','2','Jennifer Fenwick','Jennifer Fenwick has served as an Interpretation & Education Assistant since 2015.  Her role is to support division-wide education initiatives such as the Junior Ranger program and Centennial Initiatives, as well as leading I&E programs for youth.  In October of 2015, Jennifer took on a leadership role for the division in coordinating the Neighborhood Ecology Corps partnership.  The Neighborhood Ecology Corps is a partnership among NC State University, the City of Raleigh Parks & Recreation to engage African American middle and high school students from Raleigh\\\'s urban center in the great outdoors through science-based experiences.  Jennifer coordinated taking 15 students camping and canoeing at Merchants Millpond State Park, including working with the park superintendent and Friends Group to secure funding.  Jennifer worked with the I&E Manager Sean Higgins to plan a three-day camping excursion to Grandfather Mountain and Mount Mitchell for more than 20 youth.  When Sean Higgins could not attend because of a medical emergency, Jennifer was put in the role of primary leader for this trip.rnrnWhen State Parks Director Mike Murphy challenged the I&E Program to do more in supporting the Neighborhood Ecology Corps, the I&E Manager suggested a leadership camp to empower the current students to be leaders for  new students just starting the program.  However, the I&E Manager told Jennifer that he thought State Parks did not have the time or staff resources necessary to pull it off.  Jennifer stepped up to the plate saying, \\\"you have me, I\\\'ll lead it\\\".  Jennifer essentially assumed the role of director for the first Outdoor Leadership Academy, which was a weeklong overnight leadership camp at Haw River and Hanging Rock State Parks.  She developed leadership curriculum, coordinated CPR and outdoor safety classes for the students, and worked with the students to develop and present their own interpretive programs.  In directing the camp, Jennifer spent 170 hour straight in the great outdoors with twelve 14-16 year-olds from the city.  One student said, \\\"I appreciated learning what it takes to be a responsible leader\\\".  In closing remarks, students chose one word to describe their experience.  Here are some of the words chosen:  Courage, commitment, change, hard-work, positive attitude, teamwork, encouragement, joy.','sean.higgins@ncparks.gov','919-805-2194','','INED','STWD','2016-10-17','','','Yes','','Yes','Yes','Yes','','','','Yes','0000-00-00','','Higgins6125,Higgins6125,Higgins6125,Higgins6125,Higgins6125,Greenwood3841,Greenwood3841,Tillotson5212,Gallagher9613,Bash8938,Blanchard3795','','','','',''),(97,'AN_097','2016','','6','Kenneth Richard Goad','On July 24, 2016, Alvero Restrepo and his wife Luz, hiked the Alder Trail in Lake Norman State Park along with their sons: 13-year-old Victor, 11-year-old Martin, and 5-year-old Samuel.  Family friends, 78-year-old Melida Ramos and her daughter 62-year-old Alba Ramos, joined the Restrepos on their trip to the park.  At approximately 5:40 pm on that date, Victor and Samuel Restrepo, who were playing in the water on the lake shore, fell into deeper water and began to flounder.  Alvero Restrepo, Martin Restrepo, and Alba Ramos entered the water in an attempt to assist Victor and Samuel and were soon also in distress.  rnrnFishing nearby, Kenneth Richard â€œRichâ€ Goad and his son William heard the commotion of the people in distress in the water.  Though unable to understand the language being spoken, Rich Goad understood that lives were in jeopardy and sprang into action, sprinting 100 yards or more to the scene.  Upon arrival, Mr. Goad could see Samuel Restrepo floating face down near the surface and Alba Ramos attempting to keep her head above water.  Victor Restrepo had by this time extricated himself from the water.  Goad dialed 911 on his cellular phone and handed the phone to Victor after ascertaining that Victor could speak English.  Mr. Goad then entered the water and retrieved Samuel Restrepo.  Upon arrival back to shore, Mr. Goad performed CPR on Samuel until the boy began breathing on his own.  Mr. Goad then reentered the water to aid Alba Ramos.  Goad reached out with a tree branch toward Ramos for her to grab, but Ramos went under water.  Goad used the branch to bring Ramos closer to shore where he retrieved Alba Ramos from the water.  Mr. Goad then performed CPR on Ramos until relieved by a more highly trained bystander who arrived on the scene.  The efforts to revive Alba Ramos were unsuccessful.  rnrnThree persons perished in this tragic incident, 54-year-old Alvero Restrepo; his son Martin Restrepo; and their friend Alba Ramos.  The quick and selfless actions of Rich Goad undoubtedly saved the life of young Samuel Restrepo.

I began overseeing the CPR program in February, 2014 and during that time, Walt has never hesitated in either taking lead or assisting with a CPR class when called upon.  There were many times I would contact Walt at the last minute to see if he was available to teach a class, and it was extremely rare to hear that he couldnâ€™t teach.  He doesnâ€™t complain if he has to change his days off or work a long shift in order to cover a much-needed CPR course.  \\r\\nAs a divisional mandate, all rangers, maintenance mechanics and superintendents are required to attend a Basic Life Support CPR class each year.  Throughout the state, there are 14 CPR instructors striving to hold enough classes for all employees to fulfill their CPR classes.  The American Heart Association started using a database to enter all classes in February 2014.  Since that time, we have taught a total of 153 classes covering as much of the state as possible.  Of these, Walt has either led or assisted with 22 classes.  He has traveled to taught at FALA, ENRI, HARI, MARI, PIMO, HARO, RARO, MOMO, and CRMO to name a few.\\r\\nIâ€™ve taught many of these classes with Walt and I truly appreciate how he will tailor his teaching style to the audience.  He has assisted me each year with teaching our large seasonal staff at HARI.  The course that we teach is a step down from Basic Life Support and Walt changes his teaching style to fit the class.  Iâ€™ve never seen him make students feel inferior when they ask an off-the-wall question or perform their skills completely wrong.  Instead, he is professional and works with the student with patience and understanding.  I can honestly say that with having Walt as an instructor, my task as the CPR coordinator is lighter, knowing I can call and heâ€™ll be there.

Maness had spoken to the camper earlier about his troubled home life and she said she had a \\\'sense\\\' that he was outside in need of help. When she exited her RV to check her hunch, she saw him stumbling incoherently and assisted him in getting back to his campsite. Koch found the camper laying unconscious in the woods below a campsite. Koch administered narcan to the patient who lost pulse and stopped breathing as Koch was assessing him. He also performed CPR using his pocket mask, and later, rescue breaths to the patient as he began to revive. Sam\\\'s quick thinking, quick actions, adherence to training he had received, and bravery is the only reason the patient is alive. Koch was alone when he administered the narcan and CPR. He was joined shortly after by ranger Jason Anthony, who had been home listening to the radio. Anthony heard Koch and the host\\\'s radio traffic and assisted by providing a bag valve mask to continue rescue breaths. Anthony routinely listens to the radio on his time off, since we are short staffed and often work alone at night. Anthony\\\'s willingness to assist his coworkers on his time off should be acknowledged. rnrnRanger Austin Paul was instrumental in working with local EMS, our parks medical director, and our county medical director, to pursue getting the rangers trained to provide narcan. Stokes County is experiencing an opioid overdose epidemic. Paul\\\'s forward thinking and desire to make our patient care at HARO more professional propelled us to begin carrying narcan. rnrnThis is the first incident of rangers administering narcan in a park that I am aware of.
