(657, 'FOFI', 'Fort Fisher SRA consists of 287 acres.  Staff is also responsible for the management of Bald Head Island State Natural Area consisting of 1,260 acres.  Fort Fisher is dynamic and has a complex operation.  Annual visitation averages over 800,000 visitors a year.  We have a unique 4WD beach with 4 miles of beach to drive on which provides a unique recreational opportunity along with a challenging management plan.  The 4WD beach also has a six month 24 hour operation.  We also have a complex Resource Management Program, where we constantly have to manage and balance resource protection and recreational opportunities. We do many resource management projects in the park but one huge one is nesting sea turtles and birds.  Last year staff managed 52 sea turtle nests, the most we have ever had and numerous bird nests.  All of these complex operations are done with a very small staff.  We have only 7 permanent positions which includes a Park Superintendent, 3 Park Rangers, 2 Maintenance Mechanics, and 1 Office Assistant.  Also 2 Ranger positions were vacant during the summer last year.\r\n\r\nPark hours vary throughout the year.  8AM to 6PM November through February.  March through May, September and October 8AM to 8PM, and June through August 6AM to 9PM, and a six month 24 hour operation on the 4WD beach from September 15th to March 14th.  Obviously these hours stretch a small staff thin.  The 4WD beach closes the rest of the year 30 minutes before the park due to active nesting birds and turtles.  We do not have a permanent shift that works late during 24 hour access, but we do some 3PM to 12AM shifts during this time for safety reasons.  Work shifts include 6AM to 3PM, 8AM to 5PM, 9AM to 6PM, 11AM to 8PM, 12:30PM to 9:30 PM and 3PM to 12AM, depending on the time of year.  Also there is always one Law Enforcement Staff on call to respond to after hours emergencies.  This can be challenging as Fort Fisher has no park housing and response times can be delayed.\r\n\r\nAnother complex factor is from Memorial Day to Labor Day the park averages over 500,000 visitors.  Every weekend we deal with heavy visitation, parking and traffic control and visitor protection and safety.  All staff deal with numerous emergencies that include cuts, scrapes, dislocations, broken bones, jellyfish and stingray stings, heat exhaustion and many other illnesses or injuries.  We also do numerous hasty searches usually for missing children.  Law Enforcement staff deal with many issues many times they are minor but still time consuming.  Lifeguards made over 50 saves last year and every save is responded to by permanent staff as well.  Throughout the year all staff but primarily maintenance must keep bathrooms operational, trails and other park areas safe and operational, along with the other responsibilities mentioned above.  All of these areas experience high usage and must be maintained, inspected, and kept safe for the public.  Also during this peak time is our primary bird and sea turtle nesting season. At 6AM park staff must patrol 8 miles of beach to locate, mark, record and secure sea turtle and bird nests.  Obvious challenges are vehicles running over nests, the volume of people, and the small amount of staff to manage all this.  The park must balance Resource Protection and Recreational Opportunities.  All of our staff work very hard to balance these issues to provide a safe and fun experience, but also to protect such unique resources.  The rest of the year is still busy.  Fishing seasons run from September through November and March through May.  We still have over 300,000 visitors in our \"slower\" months.  The winter months can allow for projects and many other tasks to be worked on.\r\n\r\nAs a staff we also offered over 150 educational programs last year.  Again this was with 2 vacant ranger positions.  It took 8 months to fill the 2 ranger positions.  Those rangers are currently in Basic Law Enforcement Training and will not report back to the park until mid June.  So we will continue to be stretched very thin.  Visitor Protection and Safety will continue to be of utmost importance.\r\n\r\nFort Fisher is also very important economically.  Last year we had 81 special events at the park.  Most of these were weddings, but we do host numerous major events to include; a Sand Blast Soccer Tournament, A College Sand Volleyball Tournament, Pleasure Island Surf Fishing Challenge, Little Buddy Fishing Tournament and many others.  These events along with our visitation numbers, 4WD permit sales, and concessions contribute greatly to the local and state economies.  Last year our operating revenues were 151,111 dollars versus our operating expenses of 68,282.90.  Also the Local Economic Impact Study done by NCSU stated that local residents receive a benefit of $25.10 for every dollar the state invests into Fort Fisher SRA.  '),
(667, 'JONE', 'The following document outlines the justification for the current staffing levels at Jones Lake State Park.  The park currently has one park superintendent position, three park ranger positions, three maintenance mechanic positions, and one office assistant position.  The park currently has two vacant positions, a park ranger position and the office assistant position, which leaves the park without 25% of the work force.  The effects of these two vacant positions are already being felt and this will only get worse as we move into spring and summer and the park continues to get busier and the operational days longer.  All of these positions are absolutely essential to sustaining park operations and visitor services to a level that is expected by park visitors.  Due to the vacant Office Assistant position the park superintendent and park rangers spend much time staffing the office and answering the telephone, along with much time being spent on budget related paperwork such as p-card reconciliations, deposits, pre-approval requests, entering invoices, selling gift shop items, which has been dramatically increased in the last year, etc.  This is in addition to the great and varied demand normally placed on the workload of these positions such as natural resource management, law enforcement duties, educational programming, day to day park operations, training responsibilities etc.    Due to the vacant ranger position the park will need assistance with programming for large school groups this spring which could normally be handled by Jones Lake staff.  With the vacant ranger position the Law Enforcement staff will be stretched much thinner, as the operational day grows longer, which will result in LE staff working alone a lot more and not having back up as readily available as they typically would.    \r\n\r\nThe park must be staffed 12 or 13 hours per day seven days a week for 8 months of the year and staffed 10 hours a day seven days per week during the winter months.  A Law Enforcement Certified staff member, which consists of the park superintendent and park ranger positions, must be present at the park during all operational hours to ensure the safety of park visitors. Staff must do periodic patrols of the picnic area, campground, parking lot, trails etc.  The park also has a campground and group camp facility, which is available year round for visitors to camp overnight.  A Law Enforcement certified staff member must be on \"Stand By\" and available to respond to any conceivable emergency or other calls for service that may be made, by a camper, at any hour of the night.\r\n\r\nIn addition to managing Jones Lake State Park, which consists of 1,669 acres of land and two natural lakes, Jones Lake (224 acres) and Salters Lake (315 acres) for a total of 2,208 acres, staff are also responsible for managing Bushy Lake State Natural Area.  Bushy Lake State Natural Area consists of approximately 6,300 acres of property and is located approximately 20 miles from Jones Lake.  \r\n\r\nAs mentioned before there is a great variety of responsibilities placed on park staff.  Training alone places a significant responsibility on park staff.  The superintendent and ranger positions must maintain a Law Enforcement certification, search and rescue certifications, CPR certification, First Responder Certification, wild land firefighting certifications, and environmental educator certification.  Maintenance staff must maintain a CPR certification, First Responder certification, wild land firefighting certifications, Class A CDL\'s, Pesticide Applicator certification etc.  The superintendent and rangers provide educational programs for many area schools, especially in the spring time, when many schools are doing educational field trips.  It is very common to have 70 to 100 school children at the park for these types of programs during the spring time.  Staff also present general public educational programing year round.  Many groups and organizations will schedule educational programming year round such as cub scouts, boy scouts, girl scouts, church youth groups, home school groups, senior citizen groups etc.  Park staff also travel to schools to do educational programs in the classroom setting.  Park staff set up and staff educational booths at many venues during the year, such as local festivals, local job fairs, school career days, earth day events, etc.  Park staff also plan and conduct some large scale educational events as well.  One such event is the Jones Lake Environmental Days event where all 5th graders in Bladen County visit the park over a three day period.  Many agencies come out and help with this endeavor.  With the assistance of our Friend\'s Group, park staff also plan and conduct an annual Easter Event, which consists of an easter egg hunt and many educational activities and booths for children.  This event is open to the public. These large scale events require much planning, time, and effort to be successful.  Each year park staff conduct a park EELE, which is an educational workshop for educators. Park staff also do a variety of work in the area of resource management.  All marked park boundaries at Jones Lake and Bushy Lake must be continuously cut and remarked to prevent the marked boundary from being lost.  Prescribe burns are also conducted by park staff.  The park\'s two current rangers are either burn boss certified or on the verge of being burn boss certified.  We also have Red-cockaded Woodpecker\'s, (RCW) an endangered woodpecker, that requires special attention.  Park staff have done and will continue to do hardwood reduction and prescribed burning in these RCW management areas. Both Jones Lake area and Bushy Lake area are continually monitored for any threat of invasive species and if detected proper action is taken to mitigate this threat.  Patrols for other resource management threats such as poaching and ATV activity are done year round and especially during hunting seasons at both Jones Lake and Bushy Lake areas.  Park operations is also a significant area of staff responsibility as well.  Jones Lake has a complex summertime operation, especially for a smaller park.  Jones Lake\'s summertime operation consists of a guarded swim area, paddle boat and canoe rentals and  a concession stand, in addition to the year round campground.  In addition the large picnic shelter is reserved every Saturday and most Sundays from May through September and the visitor center also has to be staffed, since it is an important point of contact for visitors.  While some seasonal positions are hired such as Lifeguards, a concessions clerk, park attendants etc. much of these operational duties go to permanent staff such as hiring and supervising seasonal employees, managing  the day to day operational tasks of this complex operation and actually staffing these various operational areas on a regular basis, as needed.   Even the permanent Office Assistant is required to work at least half the weekends during the summer to sustain the staffing levels needed to effectively conduct these summertime operations. Maintenance staff also have many responsibilities.  Facilities, vehicles, and equipment must be maintained and repaired on a regular basis to ensure the safety of park visitors and staff and to make sure that all aspects of the park operate in an effective and efficient manner.  Facilities include a 6,000 square foot Visitor Center, 2,000 square foot bathhouse/concession building, boat stall, fishing pier, maintenance shop, maintenance office/barracks, two park residences, a shower/restroom facility in the campground, six small picnic shelters and one large picnic shelter and several storage buildings. There are 8 vehicles that must be maintained and a variety of equipment including utility vehicles, lawn mowers, weedeaters, hedgetrimmers, chainsaws, blowers, tractors, a variety of shop tools, etc. When there are this many facilities, vehicles, and various equipment to maintain there is literally always some kind of maintenance or repair that must be done to keep all facilities and equipment in a safe and usable condition.  Without this constant state of attention the park would quickly fall into an unsafe and substandard condition.  Just trying to keep up with daily routines is a big task for maintenance staff.  Daily routines consist of keeping all restroom and shower facilities properly cleaned and maintained, cleaning all campsites after each visit, checking and changing all trash receptacles, cleaning each shelter after each use, cleaning each grill after every use, picking up all trash in the picnic area and parking lot etc.  Several acres of grass has to be mowed and weedeated, every week, during the majority of the year.  The six miles of hiking trails at the park have to be continously trimmed during the growing season.  Maintenance staff oversee all work that has to be completed by a contractor ensuring that the work is performed per the scope of work and is up to standard.  Maintenance staff also are responsible for various reports such as the monthly park safety audit, fuel and vehicle reports, community service worker reports, researching specifications for pieces of equipment, writing the scope of work for large scale maintenance projects, etc. Maintenance staff also supervise seasonal park attendant positions and community service workers. \r\n\r\nPark staff also have a responsibility to respond to statewide emergencies such as hurricanes and other natural disasters, wild fires, search and rescue incidents etc.  Jones Lake staff, in the past, have deployed and assisted with wild fires, hurricanes, and search and rescue incidents and will be called upon in the future to respond, at a moments notice, to these types of situations, often being deployed for several days and up to a week.  When these staff members are away assisting with these duties the park and all of its operations do not shut down.  Staff not assisting with the actual incident must step in and fill in for staff that are gone and make sure that a high level of service is still provided at the park.  Staff at Jones Lake also provide a great deal of assistance to other parks.  Just in the last 9 months Jones Lake staff have assisted in a variety of areas at several parks.  Five staff members worked anywhere from one to three weeks at Morrow Mountain to help clean up storm damage.  One staff member spent three days assisting with tree removal on the Lumber River.  Maintenance staff have built gates for Carvers Creek, Raven Rock, and Morrow Mountain.  One Maintenance staff member has worked, on average, at least one day per week at Weymouth Woods, since October, to assist due to all of this park\'s maintenance positions being vacant. Three park staff have spent a total of 4 days assisting Lake Waccamaw with tree removal for a resource management project.  Park staff have also assisted with special events at Lumber River and Weymouth Woods. \r\n\r\nThere is an ever increasing demand put on park staff for various reports, paperwork and information requests related to budgets, purchasing, human resources, hiring and a variety of other administrative functions.  The requirements, processes, and procedures change often and deadlines are often short.  These administrative functions require considerable time of park staff.\r\n\r\nIn Summary, as stated previously, all current positions are absolutely essential for the park to be operated in a safe and effective manner and a level of services provided that park visitors expect and should receive.  \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        '),
(668, 'JORD', 'Jordan Lake State Recreation Area is a large and complex operation. It consists of nine recreation areas (6,000 acres), two satellite areas, Deep River (1,118 acres) and Lower Haw Natural Area (1,227 acres), two 24-hour boat access areas, four wastewater plants (flow from 2700 gallons per day to 43,000 gallons per day), nine wastewater lagoons, forty-two sewer pump stations containing eighty-four pumps, one sub surface system, sixty-eight acres of above ground spray fields, and approximately thirty-eight miles of gravity and force main sewer lines accommodating approximately 55 public restrooms, 1,100 campsites, 10 group campsites, 26 hike-in primitive campsites, 11 picnic shelters.  Jordan Lake Recreation Area also includes: 7 swimming areas, 11 boat ramps, and many miles of hiking trails, with annual attendance of over a million visitors. Amenities at Jordan Lake are open to the public from 10 to 14 hours (depending on the season) daily for seven days a week. Approximately 20,000 advance facility reservation were processed for Jordan Lake by administrative support staff at the park, the call center and online. \r\n\r\nSeveral organizations utilize Jordan Lake facilities for their special events: Raleigh 70.3 Ironman Race ( 1,800 participants), NCSU Bike Race (800 participants), Ride for Kids Charity Motorcycle Bike Ride (600 bikers), Warriors on the Water Fishing Event (300 boaters), FLW (250 boaters), Bass Masters (200 Boaters), Finish Strong Half-Ironman (500 participants) and Beyond Fitness Open Water Swim (200 participants)\r\n\r\nJordan Lake currently has two administrative support (office assistant IV and a processing assistant III) employed that provide support to park staff and serve as the primary point of contact for most park visitors.  Theses positions are responsible for administrative duties within the park, including processing invoices for payment, reconciling purchasing card receipts, preparing bank deposits, reviewing and tracking park expenditures and preparing and reviewing reports for the Park Superintendent.  Additionally, this position manages the seasonal employee hiring and payroll program, process special activity permits, facility reservation requests and the office supply inventory. Both positions also gathers and enters various data into on-line databases which provide important information and statistics for the Division and Department.\r\n    \r\nCurrently 17 commissioned rangers (including the 2 superintendents) are employed at Jordan Lake. Responsibilities for commissioned staff  include protection and safety, emergency medical response, fire fighting, search and rescue operations, traffic control, conduct foot patrols and assist with crowd control. Previous law enforcement and emergency response by ranger staff have included: indecent liberties with a minor, drug possession, DWIâ€™s, assaults, suicides, stranded boaters, stolen vehicles and water related fatalities. Commission staff averages approximately 80 after hour callouts per year.  Rangers also present hundreds of environmental education programs each year for park visitors, civic groups, and surrounding schools. \r\n\r\nThere are 11 maintenance positions (including 1 facility maintenance supervisor, 6 maintenance mechanics, 2 auto mechanics, 1 water/wastewater operator and 1 trades worker) assigned to Jordan Lake. Maintenance positions at Jordan Lake play a vital and essential role in the day-to-day operation of this complex organization. Jordan Lake State Recreation Area, being an extremely popular and highly used recreational facility, requires extensive routine and preventative maintenance. The auto mechanics are responsible for the upkeep and repairs of fifty-five park trucks, two dump trucks, six tractors, fifteen mowers and various small engine equipment.  The maintenance mechanic positions ensure that all public restrooms, all campsites, picnic shelters, day use and swim beach areas are maintained in a safe and sanitary condition for all visitors. They are also responsible for minor repairs to building and waterlines. The water/wastewater operator and trades worker positions are responsible for managing, operating, performing maintenance on the wastewater, water treatment and distribution and collection systems located at Jordan Lake SRA. \r\n\r\nPrior budget reductions affected Jordan Lake staffing with the elimination of one administrate staff (Office Assistant III) one commissioned position (Ranger I) and three maintenance positions (Labor Crew Leader and two Maintenance Mechanics). Jordan Lake has another four positions ( Maintenance Mechanic IV, Maintenance Mechanic II, Advance Park Ranger and Journey Park Ranger ) which are currently vacant. Thirty-one percent of Jordan Lake\'s workforce, or nine permanent positions, have either been eliminated via past budgetary constraints or are currently vacant.  Finally, Jordan Lake over the past several years has been unable to fill approximately forty temporary positions due to budget shortfalls. These positions assist staff with revenue collection, cleaning facilities, grounds keeping, trash removal and visitor contact. Permanent staff had to take on those responsibilities along with their normal duties.\r\n'),
(670, 'LAWA', '   The park consists of 7 full-time employees and each employee plays a critical role in the day to day operations of the park.  The park currently has 1 Superintendent, 3 Park Rangers, 2 Maintenance Mechanics, and 1 Office Assistant.  The complex operational status of the park renders the strong need to have these employees working on site.\r\n\r\n   Lake Waccamaw State Park consists of 2,300 acres of land and a 9,000 acre bay lake.  Lake Waccamaw has been called, \"one of a kind\", due to its extreme biodiversity of plants and animals.  The lake contains 7 endemic species that are found nowhere else in the world.   The park has four hiking trails ranging from 1 mile to up to 5 miles in length.  The park contains four primitive tent camping sites that can accommodate up to 25-30 people per site.   Other facilities include an park visitor center, maintenance area, picnic area, one residence, and two piers with access to the lake.  The park also controls three other sections of park land to include a 4 acre partial of land with a public boat ramp, an undeveloped 440 acre tract of land on the northwestern side of the lake, and a 3 acre tract at the lake\'s southwestern side at the headwaters of the Waccamaw River. State Lake Regulations require permitting, annual fee collection and inspection of all 500 private pier structures on the lake.  Presently, there are also 300 mooring buoys for boats which are also permitted on Lake Waccamaw.  State Lake Operations require a multitude of staff members to include rangers, maintenance, and office assistant for an efficient overall operation from pier/buoy permitting, wake zone pole replacement, pier/buoy safety inspections, and the processing of all state lake regulations. Currently, the park is open year round with hours of operation of 8AM-6PM for the months of November, December, January, and February, 8AM-8PM for the months of March, April, May, September, and October, 8AM - 9PM for the months of June, July, August. The park accommodates over 145,000 visitors each year.\r\n\r\n     The Superintendent and all ranger staff are currently law enforcement commissioned and rotate between opening and closing shifts periodically throughout the year with rangers working sometimes as late as 10:00PM to register campers and close facilities.  Ranger staff serves as the backbone of emergency response in the park throughout the year.  Each ranger who works a closing shift is also required to be on call for any number of emergency response situations that range from law enforcement encounters, search and rescue (both on park land and the state lake), building alarms, and any number of emergency medical situations.  Local Fire, Law Enforcement, and EMS departments are not adequately equipped or trained to handle park emergencies.  Park staff is trained in First Responder/CPR, Search and Rescue, GPS/compass, and is trained to operate any number of emergency response vehicles to include but not limited to UTV\'s, ATV\'s, and patrol boats.  Ranger staff are also critical in the management and protection of the park\'s natural resources.  Lake Waccamaw State Park has many unique and special features to include the lake\'s plant and animal biodiversity,and carnivorous plants.    \r\n\r\n     Lake Waccamaw State Park maintenance staff have been a true asset to the park as well and serve to keep our facilities clean, maintained, and inspected properly.  They have experience with plumbing, carpentry, HVAC, electrical, and equipment operation.  Our park could not sustain the overall good customer services without having an efficient maintenance personnel like at our park.  Park maintenance staff responds to various emergencies to include water/sewer issues, structural damage to visitor facilities, and any HVAC problems.   \r\n\r\nOffice Assistant routinely stays after hours to complete any and all vital operational reports, bank deposits, and serves as the main line of communication when emergency response from 911 is initiated.\r\n\r\n     Lake Waccamaw State Park conducted over 216 programs for 2013 for a total attendance of 4,842 visitors.  This was accomplished by extremely hard working and dedicated staff members to provide a better visitor experience to the park.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),
(677, 'RARO', 'Hours of Operation & Staffing Levels:  The park and facilities are open year round except for Christmas Day.  From Nov-Feb, the park is open 8am-6pm.  From Mar-May & Sept-Oct, the park is open 8am-6pm.  From Jun-Aug, the park is open 8am-9pm.  The Visitor Center is open 8am-5pm daily.  If fully staffed the park has nine staff including one park superintendent, two park rangers, two maintenance mechanics, one office assistant, two seasonal maintenance employees and one weekend seasonal office assistant.  Park staff work 8 hour shifts with at least one ranger closing in the evenings.  Maintenance staff are scheduled on rotation to work closing shifts on the weekends.\r\n\r\nOperations, Facilities, Recreation & Attractions:  The park has one major day-use area and one bridle-use satellite area.  The satellite area is located 20 miles, or 32 minutes, away from the park office.  The park\'s main attraction is Raven Rock (150\' cliffs on the river).  Recreational opportunities include 20 miles of hiking trails, 8 of which are available for horseback riding, paddling on the Cape Fear River, camping in one of three primitive campgrounds and picnicking. The park managed 17 special activity permits and held several park events in 2013.\r\n\r\nMaintenance: Maintenance staff work to keep facilities clean, grounds mowed and equipment maintained.  They also help with maintaining trails and hazardous tree removal.  After major weather events and flooding, staff work hard to make repairs and get facilities reopened in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nNatural Resource Management:  One ranger is assigned responsibilities associated with the park\'s natural resource management program.  The park has several significantly rare and threatened species in the park.  There are many areas majorly impacted by invasive and exotic species.  In 2013 the park started a large scale forest restoration project to try and return a planted pine plantation into an oak/hickory stand.  The park has not burned most of its prescriptions in 12 years mostly due to staff limitations and not having a burn boss on staff.  The park managed 11 Scientific Research & Collecting Permits in 2013.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Education: One ranger is assigned responsibilities associated with the park\'s environmental education program.  The park has two rangers and a park superintendent that help with providing educational opportunities to the public.  The park\'s current office assistant has received her environmental education certification and leads advertised programs and events.  The park offered 148 programs in 2013 that reached 4,013 people.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response and Law Enforcement:  The park\'s visitor attendance has grown in the last five years, especially on weekends.  Ranger and maintenance staff are responsible for responding to medical emergencies and lost visitors.  Typical emergency calls are due to heat-related illnesses and major sprains/strains and sometimes broken bones.  In the evenings, park staff often search for lost hikers and owners of vehicles left in the parking lot after hours.  Since all camping at the park is primitive, rangers must also patrol these areas on foot when vehicle access is not available.  Rangers also perform a great deal of law enforcement, some of which requires a large amount of time per incident to investigate, write reports and follow-up with in court.  Most incidents involve response from one or more agencies including the Fire Department, EMS and Sheriffs Office.  Park staff are also subject to being called out state-wide to other state parks and DENR managed area for searches, weather damage, wildfire response, EMS incidents, etc.\r\n\r\nCommunity Connection: The park is one of only a few places locally to recreate which draws in a lot of local usage and local support.  The economic benefit of the park to the surrounding communities is very important.  The park has an active and diverse seven member park advisory committee that provides great assistance to the park in representing the general community.  The park recently established its own friends group to help the park with operational needs including educational and volunteer opportunities.  One ranger is also the park\'s Volunteer Coordinator and works with volunteers to find where help is needed.\r\n\r\nReduced Services Due to Current Staffing Level: The park is fairly complex to have such a small staff.  Staff are required to be multi-specialists in order for the park to operate effectively.  Three vacant full-time positions (Journey Park Ranger, MMI, and OAIII) were eliminated at the beginning of FY 11-12 due to legislative budget cuts.  In late 2013, we had to reduce our seasonal workers from 6 to 3 positions to adjust for seasonal budget cuts.  We have been without a Maintenance Mechanic III (maintenance supervisor) now for 11 months.  We were without one of our two park ranger positions for 10 months in 2013.\r\n'),
(679, 'WEWO', 'Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve utilizes a superintendent, two park rangers, one maintenance mechanic and one administrative position to operate every day of the year but Christmas. The park office and exhibit hall are open to visitors every day 8am-5pm, with gates remaining open until 8pm during the months of March through October and until 6pm during the months of November through February. Each staff member works 40 hours a week, in 8-hour shifts. The superintendent and two ranger staff rotate holidays, weekends and weekdays to cover all operational hours. After hours, responses to law enforcement situations, emergencies, or maintenance issues are on a call-out basis.\r\n\r\nThe preserve consists of the main operational access area with the visitor center with a gated parking lot, and 2 satellite areas containing several access points that are hike-in only. All 3 areas are located close to one another and you can drive from one to the next within 5 minutes. Facilities to be operated and maintained include, a large visitor center with a museum, auditorium, staff offices and a greeting area for park visitors, a maintenance facility that houses tools and equipment and provides a work area for staff, 6 miles of trail, several miles of fire breaks, and two park residences.\r\n\r\n The preserve consists of 930 acres, of which 600 need to be managed with a prescribed burn program in order to maintain a rare longleaf / wiregrass ecosystem. A prescribed burn program has been maintained in this park since 1970. A minimum of 6 trained personnel are required to safely administer a prescribed burn, to include rangers, maintenance, and seasonal staff. It is also typical for the park to borrow help from other parks and other agencies because we have a small staff at Weymouth. In return we offer our staff to help those same parks and agencies in their burn programs. Control and removal of invasive species through physical and chemical means are also a high priority for maintaining the integrity of the preserveâ€™s high-quality habitat. \r\n \r\nStaff involvement in both education and natural resource management efforts contribute to the preservation of federally endangered species that reside on park property. Species that are tracked by North Carolinaâ€™s Natural Heritage program include, Red-cockaded Woodpecker, Bachmanâ€™s Sparrow, Sandhills Pixie Moss, Michauxâ€™s Sumac, Pine Barrens Treefrog and many others. We strive to educate the public on the unique habitat maintained in the park and the resulting existence of endangered species. These efforts help endear this park and others to the public. Weymouth Woods provides numerous educational opportunities to the public, averaging approximately 200 a year, and reaching as many as 9,500 participants. We provide educational opportunities for various groups including school groups from pre-k through college, scout troops, community organizations, summer camps, assisted living facilities, home school groups, as well as the general public. The park is also home to some large events such as trail races and the Palustris Festival.\r\n\r\nCurrently, one maintenance staff member is responsible for upkeep of all of facilities to include electrical, heating/air, plumbing, vehicle repair and maintenance, trails, and landscaping, in addition to helping with natural resource management responsibilities. This position is currently vacant and as a result many things have been put off or delayed until help could be borrowed from other parks. Two seasonal staff are utilized to assist in these duties. \r\n\r\nEveryday operations such as keeping the office open, answering the phone, greeting visitors, paying bills, sorting and sending out mail, updating various computer databases, scheduling groups, managing use of visitor center and many other important duties are all contributed by the administrative assistant.

Rangers are important because they are familiar with the park needs in law enforcement situations.\r\n    Emergency response. Rangers respond to medical emergencies, injuries, suicides, and mental illness. Ranger and Maintenance staff are medical first responders and are necessary to provide transitional care until EMS is able to respond.  This transitional care from staff knowledgeable about the park is critical since EMS is not always familiar with or prepared for trail and back country response.

After-hours responses to law enforcement, emergency medical incidents, single and multi-operational period searches, and maintenance issues are common, averaging five to six responses of at least one, and sometimes more rangers, per month.  \r\nPark staff is a vital link in the response time for emergencies in the park especially the back country area. Local EMS response time is 45 minutes to over an hour just to arrive at the park not including hiking in several miles to a patient. There are four public access areas spread more than 20 miles/45 minutes apart including the Hunter Access for Thurmond Chatham Gamelands and Mountains to Sea Trail access from Devils Garden Overlook from the Blue Ridge Parkway. Stone Mountain also manages Bullhead Mountain State Natural Area located north of the Blue Ridge Parkway. All of these accesses need to be regularly patrolled for both visitor and park safety.

This is a regulated public water system. \r\nThe bulk of the park administration is handled by the park superintendent and office assistants. The rest of the staff assist with various collateral duties such as: safety coordinator, lead law enforcement ranger, lead natural resource ranger, lead I&E ranger and volunteer coordinator. the park superintendent and office assistants handle purchasing, accounts payable and receivable, BEACON time administration, CRS reports, bank deposits and numerous monthly reports that are required to support the operation of the park. \r\nThe park currently has two vacant positions, a park ranger position and a office assistant position. The park experienced a reduction in force with the loss of one park ranger position in 2010. Due to the vacancies and the RIF position all park staff has had to absorb extra responsibilities in efforts to provide the best visitor experience. There has been a drop in some of the services we offer due to these vacancies. We are not able to have the visitor center open to the public seven days of the week, we are not able to offer as many I&E programs, staff is not able to patrol trails and access areas for visitor safety and routine maintenance and resource management operates at a minimal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),

This amounts to more than 4300 public operating hours annually, not counting special events, emergency responses, and other issues.  Depending on season, two or three partially overlapping shifts, as well as an overnight emergency responder who remains on call for the safety of the 53 campsites that are spread over 8 different areas, are required to properly maintain and operate the park.  After-hours responses to law enforcement, emergency medical incidents, searches, and maintenance issues are common, averaging five to six responses of at least one, and sometimes more rangers, per month.  The park includes four public access areas which are spread more than 30 miles/45 minutes apart, as well as many areas where private property accesses the park\'s trail system.  All of these areas must be regularly patrolled for both visitor and park safety.  With access areas spread so far apart, regular patrol and maintenance is a challenge to keep up with.  South Mountains provides as many as 450 public environmental education programs per year to more than 14,000 visitors, including school groups, civic groups, scout troops, outreach programs, and the general public.  During the months of April and May, it is not at all uncommon to provide nine programs per day, five days per week, involving three to four ranger staff.  Natural resource management at South Mountains is dynamic in nature due to the size of the park.  Park staff maintain 45 miles of designated trails, 33 of which are equestrian trails, multiple miles of mountain trout streams, a 21 acre lake and approx. 60 miles of park boundary.  The park conducts monthly, quarterly, and annual resource management surveys to include: water quality, bats, birds, black bear, hard mast, fish, wildflowers, mammals, rare and endangered plants.  The park is also active in Hemlock Woolly Adelgid treatment and monitoring.  Operation and maintenance of facilities include over 60 structures to maintain, including the park\'s visitor center, maintenance building, 15 site equestrian campground with a bathhouse, newly renovated 18 site family campground with bathhouse, 20 pack-in campsites ranging from 1.5-6.0 miles in one-way distance, multiple parking areas, picnic areas and a picnic shelter.

Park Rangers conduct routine and random patrols of high use areas, 45+ miles of trails, points of interest, park roads, parking areas and remote undeveloped areas.  Daytime and nighttime law enforcement details are conducted in areas where deemed necessary to enhance visitor protection and safety.  These enforcement details require two or more officers to be conducted safely. Park staff respond to all emergency medical and search and rescue related calls and reports.  Park staff provides on average, services for 20 EMS and 10 SAR reports annually.  South Mountains staff assist with LE, SAR and wild land firefighting operations at other parks throughout the state.  Many park trails can only be patrolled by foot.  Wider trails can be patrolled with patrol trucks and all terrain vehicles.  During fiscal year 2012-2013 the park earned $50,613.00 in rental receipts and purchase for resale line items.  There were $7,067.00 in purchase for retail expenses, for a total net profit of $43,932.00.  Revenue generation is expected to increase substantially with the opening of the newly renovated Family Campground, as well as the addition of electric power to the Equestrian Campground sites.  Support groups, such as The Friends Of South Mountains State Park, are active participants in park management.  The community is benefited by the creation of seasonal staffing and is an economic driver by bringing in tourist dollars to the area.  This park has already lost two permanent positions to budget reductions; an Office Assistant position in 2010, and a Park Ranger position in 2012.  The loss of these positions have already greatly impacted the amount of programming, patrol, administrative assistance, and resource management abilities the park is able to handle.  With the increased visitation expected from the newly renovated and improved camping facilities, the current staffing level will not be sufficient to meet all visitor use and safety needs.  An additional park ranger position has been authorized to help with the increased demand.  The park is currently operating with three park ranger vacancies.  This is absolutely not sustainable through the busy spring, summer and fall seasons.  If we aren\'t able to fill these positions quickly, we will have no choice but to cancel many already scheduled school programs, resource management projects, and trail improvements.  \r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           ');

Pilot Mountain combines the operational aspects of 3 different parks: A mountain popular for camping, rock climbing, hiking, cycling, and trail running;  a river popular for canoeing, fishing, swimming, camping and hiking; and a day use park near a metro area of 1.5 million people.  Pilot Mountain is 2 separate park units under 1 management, with the potential to be at capacity year round. Due to operational and law enforcement needs, and the extended 50 mile round trip to reach all park accesses, two rangers are needed on the late shift operations. When ranger staffing is reduced due to vacancies, leave, or training, it is not possible to patrol all visitor use areas.   Less visited areas are patrolled infrequently and encroachment issues are more frequent in backcountry areas from poaching and all-terrain-vehicles.  Rangers patrol 21 miles and 3600 acres of hazardous mountain backcountry, mostly on foot.  In 2013 rangers prosecuted 37 criminal violations and conducted  law enforcement and a traffic accident investigations.\r\n     Rangers must cover the park year round with daily operating hours that range from 10 hours in the winter, to 12 hours in spring and fall, and 13 hours in the summer.

Rangers mark in excess of twenty miles of boundary line; identify monitor, and eradicate exotic invasive species; monitor for forest insect pests; and conduct prescribed burns. Rangers also conduct law enforcement patrols of the park\'s facilities and patrol 10 miles of trail, primarily on foot.  Due to the rural nature of this area of Halifax County,  they respond to local law enforcement requests for assistance. Rangers respond  and are trained in medical first responder and search and rescue operations.\r\n     Maintenance staff are charged with maintaining and repairing buildings, vehicles, equipment, and facilities.  Maintenance staff complete and oversee new construction, and major repair projects. Maintenance staff oversees the safety program and assists with the removal of all safety hazards within the park.\r\n     The Office Assistant is responsible for receiving and posting bills and invoices for payment, preparing monies received for deposit, reconciling purchase card transactions, assisting staff with purchasing, creating camping and other park facility reservations, answering telephone calls, ensuring seasonal temporary employee timesheets are entered on time, and in charge of the parkâ€™s retail center.  \r\n     Ranger, office, and maintenance staff provide visitor services with their interactions and various requests from the public. They travel and assist with any statewide emergency and or weather related event and assist other parks during staff shortages, while maintaining park operations.\r\n     The park is now adding 6 campsites to the equestrian area, and 10 miles of mountain bike trails. Having two separate campgrounds will spread out staff operations. The mountain bike trails will put more demand on current staff.   These trails will enter areas where there were no previous visitor facilities.  Mountain bike trails increase injuries and a need for extractions. Due to these additions there is one Maintenance Mechanic position that has been approved in the operational reserve budget. \r\n     Current staffing levels allow only minimal park coverage and inadequate coverage during vacancies, leave, and training.   Working alternating schedules often prevents the two rangers from working together limiting work requiring multiple staff. During periods of longer operating hours there are 4 hour blocks during the day the park will go without a ranger. \r\n     Medoc Mountain works closely with Halifax County Convention and Visitors bureau, Haliwa-Saponi Tribal Council, and the Hollister Chamber of Commerce.   Medoc Mountain State Park is located in one of the top five poorest counties in North Carolina and is an economic and quality of life asset.\r\n'),
(690, 'MARI', '     Mayo River State Park has four permanent staff. \r\n     Maintenance Mechanic II: The MM II performs daily operations to keep the park functioning, to include custodial duties in restrooms, picnic areas, parking lots, trails, offices, and the public contact station. He is responsible for mowing operations. He maintains all park equipment, to include a variety of gas and diesel power machines and  hand tools. He serves as park safety officer, conducting  monthly inspections and meetings. He maintains the parkâ€™s safety supplies and equipment, to include the AED, fire truck, and pumper unit. He is responsible for all maintenance issues that arise in the park. He assists with duties normally assigned to rangers such as boundary marking and invasive species eradication.   He supervises two seasonal temporary employees.\r\n     Park Ranger I â€“ The ranger I is our primary Interpretive and Education Ranger. He prepares and presents environmental education programs on and off site and participates in community festivals annually. The ranger I is also the primary Natural Resources Ranger. He conducts resource management programs that consist primarily of invasive species eradication and boundary management. The 2,200+ acre park has extensive boundary to be marked in twelve separate tracts. The ranger I is the person primarily responsible for getting it marked. He also conducts routine patrols of the park,  trails, roads, and boundaries. As a sworn law enforcement officer, he makes arrests, issues citations, and verbal warnings to ensure compliance with park regulations and NC law. He also serves the Division as a CPR instructor.  The ranger I assists with daily operations and maintenance functions. \r\n     Park Superintendent â€“ The park superintendent supervises all staff, helping to prepare work plans and work plan assessments, providing guidance and coaching.  He prepares required reports including timesheet management and approval, ensures compliance with Division, Department, state, and federal guidelines. He serves as park liaison to the community and park neighbors, and keeps an active park Advisory Committee.  He serves as the lead law enforcement officer at the park. Also serves the Division Law Enforcement Firearms Instructor and armorer, conducting mandated annual in-service training. Because of the small staff at the park, the superintendent also participates in daily cleanup, some mowing, maintenance operations, invasive species control and boundary management, as well as presenting programs and conducting the parkâ€™s public canoe programs on the Mayo River.\r\n     Office Assistant II â€“ Prepares and processes reports, financial statements, bills, time management reports, inventories, serves as primary public contact in the office, prepares deposits, tracks reservations,  assists with informational displays for the park, and assists in office cleanup. \r\n     The park is open 364 days a year.   It encompasses twelve separate tracts stretching along 15.5 miles of the Mayo River.  The two law enforcement positions rotate opening and closing shifts, and the schedule is arranged so that a LE position is conducting closing operations. As there are only two officers, occasionally the park is staffed by only the office assistant or maintenance mechanic.   When the park only has one officer working (during staff shortages, state holidays, leave, training) that officer will work from opening to closing, logging between a nine and thirteen hour day, depending on time of year. The mowing work load is difficult for maintenance staff to keep up with, in conjunction with operational duties and major projects. The office assistant keeps the office open to the public from 8:00 â€“ 5:00 Mon â€“ Fri, but there is not weekend office staff , so the visitor contact station is closed on weekends or when the office assistant is on leave, at training, or vacant.  \r\n'),
(691, 'LANO', 'Lake Norman State Park (LANO) operates 7 days/week, 365 days/year, with the exception of Christmas Day. Hours of operation range from 8am-6pm in the winter to 8am-9pm in the summer.  Day/night shifts for Park Superintendent (PASU) and Park Rangers (PR) include 40 hrs over 5 days/wk. Maintenance Mechanics (MM) are required to work day shifts comprised of 40 hrs over 4/5 days/wk. PR/MM staff are required to work weekends/holidays. The Office Assistant (OA) is required to work day shifts comprised of 40 hrs over 5 days/wk, to include holidays and some weekends. During peak months, shifts start at 7am to approx. 10pm, creating a 15 hour day comprised of multiple shifts. This leads to staff working alone most of the time with heavy visitation. On-call/closing ranger staff can expect frequent, extended work time to handle emergency, administrative and operational needs. After hours response to law enforcement (LE), emergencies, and maintenance situations are handled by the on-call/closing PR staff. Occasional call backs for assistance are needed after hours of operations. LANO has 2 entrances to include the main entrance on State Park Rd and a side entrance at the intersection of State Park Rd and St. Johns Rd. Multiple gates are needed to close park facilities while still allowing access to an inholding of private residence on Loblolly Dr. Most park facilities can be accessed off of State Park Rd which dead ends in the park after traveling approx. 4 mi through the center of the park. Basic operations take up the majority of LANO staff time. Seasonal staff and volunteers are instrumental in daily operations to maintain the beauty/safety of park facilities, or support visitor services (EE/Resource Management). PR staff operate an active Environmental Education (EE) program by offering 4-5 EE programs/wk. Special program requests from school/scout groups, and churches are very frequent. Since creation in 1962, many of the early park facilities are structurally declining due to increased public use and age. Many times, repairs are limited to temporary fixes or passed over due to lack of funds. Facilities that get heavy uses such as restrooms, trails, and campsites experience very frequent failures to include water leaks/breaks/excessive wear and tear. These failures constantly tie up at least one PR/MM placing an even greater burden on an already small staff.  MM staff is required to operate the parks drinking water supply and waste water treatment facility. Grounds keeping is major component of the MM staff\'s daily operations-Peak months: mowing; Fall: campsites/roads frequently need to be cleared of leaves/debris; Winter months: closed facilities winterized to avoid damage due to freezing, and roads need to be cleared of snow/ice. Administrative duties include, but not limited to, the managing of budgets, hiring/training of staff, preparing invoices/contracts for payment, reconciling P-card purchases, deposits, report preparation, and operation of Reservation System. Recreational opportunities include the only public swimming area on Lake Norman, boat rentals/launch, use of facilities, and approx. 40 mi of hiking/biking trails.\r\n\r\nLANO regularly ranks within the top 10 most visited NC State Parks. Within an hour\'s drive of LANO, there\'s a population of 2.5+ million people, including the state\'s largest city, Charlotte. Local areas are growing quickly as new developments are being constructed in close proximity to LANO. 2012 park attendance was about 525,000 with about  in revenue. These large crowds overwhelm park staff, resulting in frequent occurrence of LE, emergency medical and other incidents during the peak months and increasingly in the off season.  A major management concern is the small size of PR/MM staff as compared to visitation and number/types of facilities. Even during infrequent times of full staffing, many visitor services are reduced because of increasing demand of park operation due to staff/visitor ratio. Vacant positions/staff health issues place the remaining staff under increased stress to perform not only their own duties, but those of others.  Many times this results in the need of frequent assistance from local agencies or other parks/district staff, which places an increased burden on other staff and facilities.  The addition of a new visitor center increases the need for a new PR, MM, and OA. Without these positions, current staff will be stretched thinner and unable to offer continued visitor services at an already reduced rate.'),
(693, 'LAJA', 'Lake James State Park consists of the 565 acre Catawba River Area, established in 1987, and the nearly 3,000 acre Paddy\'s Creek Area, purchased in 2005, bringing its total to 3,515 acres. The new facilities in the Paddy\'s Creek Area opened to the public during the fall of 2010. The park maintains operating hours to the general public seven days per week, 364 days per year, with an average annual attendance of +/- 400,000.  This amounts to more than 4300 public operating hours annually, not counting special events, emergency responses, and other issues.  Depending on season, two or three partially overlapping shifts, as well as an overnight emergency responder who remains on call for the safety of the 20 campsites and 24-hour boat access, are required to properly maintain and operate the park. After-hours responses to law enforcement, emergency medical incidents, searches, and maintenance issues are common.  Lake James provides as many as 200 programs per year to more than 4,000 visitors, including school groups, civic groups, scout troops, outreach programs, and the general public.  \r\n\r\nThere are four public access areas separated by approximately 4 miles of highway, as well as many areas where private property accesses the park\'s trail system, and all of these areas must be regularly patrolled for both visitor safety protection of park resources. In addition to access by land, Lake James State Park has approximately 35 miles of lakeshore boundary that must also be monitored and patrolled by boat regularly.\r\n\r\nThe on-going re-development of the park has resulted in distinct areas of park resources between the original park and the new property.  The parks\' primary resources have begun to transfer from the original area, to the new property at Paddy\'s Creek, meaning that the original park will ultimately be managed more like a large satellite area of the new property.  This satellite area will have its own large picnic area and campground as well as two boat ramps and a reservable swim beach. This area currently consists of traditional water-based recreation activities to include boating and fishing as well as camping, hiking, picnicking and nature study. Already existing on this property are an office, picnic area, swimming area, campground washhouse, maintenance shop, 4.2 miles of hiking trails, boardwalks, piers as well as utilities consisting of water, electrical and sewer systems. \r\n\r\nThe new areas of the park include a remote boat-in only campground on the Long Arm Peninsula, which is currently under construction and scheduled to be in operation by the summer of 2014, and the Paddy\'s Creek Area which currently consists of boating, fishing, swimming, hiking, picnicking and nature study, with campground plans in the design phase and 14 + miles of mountain bike trails under construction, also scheduled to be in operation by the summer of 2014. Already existing on this property are an office, picnic area, swimming area, concession stand, bathhouse, maintenance shop, 7+ miles of hiking trails, fishing pier as well as utilities consisting of water, electrical and sewer systems. \r\n\r\nLake James State Park staff carry out a wide variety of responsibilities and services. Basic park operations of the above mentioned facilities takes up the majority of the staff\'s time. Specifically, the maintenance staff is in charge of maintaining all of the park vehicles, equipment, facilities, and grounds. Maintaining some of these facilities requires additional certifications such as C-well certification for the drinking water systems and sub-surface wastewater certification for the two large-scale septic systems. The recent addition of new facilities has created a new Maintenance Mechanic I position that has yet to be filled. The ranger staff is responsible for law enforcement, safety, emergency response at the park and statewide, environmental education and visitor services, natural resource management, coordination of the volunteer program, lake patrol and swim area operations to include life guards, concessions, and boat rentals. Administration and management of all of the above is overseen by the park superintendent with strong support from the office assistant.  The management also involves coordination with several other agencies involving two county governmens, several other state agencies and the US Forest Service and National Park Service.\r\n'),
(694, 'KELA', '     Kerr Lake State Recreation Area is a complex unit in the NC state park system.  It is comprised of seven individual recreation areas with each offering camping and day use, located along the shoreline of JH Kerr Reservoir. In addition, there are two marina subleases and one satellite area. The distance between individual areas ranges from five miles (8 minutes) to 29 miles (45 minutes). \r\n     Kerr Lake is open 364 days a year.  Hours of operation for day use are 13 hours in summer, 12 hours in spring and fall, and 10 hours in winter.  Two campgrounds and three boat ramps are open 24 hours every day.  There are ranger staff, maintenance staff and office staff on duty seven days-a-week.  Maintenance primarily works a 7 am to 4pm year round with an additional 12 pm-9pm shift May- Aug.  Office staff works from 8am to 5 pm.  The ranger staff works widely varied hours, including closing shifts and opening shifts.  Rangers are expected to respond to after-hours emergencies and maintenance is expected to respond to after hour maintenance problems.  In 2013 there were 19 instances when staff members were called out to respond to an after-hours incident. \r\n     Kerr Lake is a facility-intensive park unit with high visitation.  The primary types of recreation (camping, picnicking, group building rentals, boat launching and swimming) are heavily dependent on facility maintenance and visitor service through personal contact at entrance stations, visitor center and in the field.  It takes all current office assistants, maintenance mechanics, and rangers to fulfill the division mission and provide a minimum of good service to park visitors.\r\n     The majority of staff are assigned to individual areas and responsible for operations and visitor services in their respective areas. There is only one maintenance person assigned to each of the seven areas to ensure that all the facilities there are safe, maintained, clean and usable for Kerr Lake visitors.  Each maintenance person assigned to a park is responsible for supervising a team of temporary â€œseasonalâ€ employees to provide services during the busy season.\r\n     Four areas have one ranger each and the other three have two rangers each to protect life and property by providing law enforcement, emergency response, and wild land fire suppression. County agencies do not have the resources to patrol and protect park visitors.  Rangers also manage visitor services at the entrance stations, conduct resource management activities including the removal of over 160 hazardous trees from public areas in 2013.  They provided 174 environmental education programs in 2013.  Rangers are also responsible for supervising a team of temporary â€œseasonalâ€ employees at each area to staff entrance stations, collect fees and manage reservations during the busy portion of the season. \r\n    When one of the maintenance or ranger staff is on leave, at training, or the position is vacant at a given area, generally another person from another area must cover those duties.   Kerr Lake has lost two park ranger positions due to reduction-in-force in the last six years resulting in reduced visitor services.  The park receives complaints about lack of ranger presence during vacancies and absences.\r\n     Office assistants are responsible for business management, administration, and visitor information.\r\n    Kerr Lake staff cooperates with local partnerships including Henderson-Vance Chamber of Commerce, local schools, Kerr-Tar Council of Government, local libraries and other agencies.  Kerr Lake is also economically important in a depressed region in the state.  Economic survey completed in 2005 reported that Kerr Lake brings in over $15 million in sales to the local economy.\r\n     The park staff is called upon to assist with law enforcement, search and rescue, wildfires and other critical incidents across the state, and assist other parks with staff shortages while continuing park operations.  \r\n'),
(696, 'JORI', 'Jockey\'s Ridge State Park regularly experiences the highest visitation of any state park with an average of 1.2 million visitors annually. Park hours: November-February, 8 a.m.-6 p.m.; March, April, May, September, October 8 a.m.-8 p.m.; June-August, 8 a.m.-9 p.m.; Closed Christmas Day. The park is open until 9pm during the summer, and as many as 5000 people attend sunset every evening. \r\n\r\nLaw enforcement rangers respond after hours approximately once per month in the winter, and several times per month in the summer to building alarm calls, reports of unauthorized park entry, bonfires, vandalism, or other law enforcement matters. Rangers also respond to approximately 50 life-threatening emergencies annually. Ranger staff have been deployed to several statewide emergencies and disaster events. Maintenance staff has responded after hours and on weekends to burst water pipes, roof leaks, stuck gates, and a variety of HVAC and other emergencies. Due to high visitation during busy summer months, emergency repairs to facilities and equipment are a daily occurrence. \r\n\r\nThe park has two satellite areas - Run Hill State Natural Area and the sound side access. The sound access is extremely popular, and we regularly have parking and law enforcement issues that require ranger response. Run Hill State Natural Area (123 acres) is heavily accessed by Kill Devil Hills First Flight Schools (elementary, middle, and high school) for teaching purposes. The area hosts several rare and protected plant species including Wooly Beach Heather and Maritime Pinweed. Rangers are frequently called to respond to unauthorized ATV or illegal camping use at Run Hill.\r\n\r\nIn a fairly typical year, staff will conduct approximately 360 formal programs with nearly 7200 participants. This figure does not include the literally hundreds of daily visitor interactions and small-scale interpretation that takes place at the visitor information desk and throughout the park. Polaris vehicles are utilized to provide access to the dunes for persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nWhile we are regularly the most-visited state park, we are also one of the smallest in land area (426 acres.) This requires constant attention and resource management to minimize the effects of visitors upon the resource. \r\n\r\nPast law enforcement interactions have included dealing with mentally disturbed persons, persons with firearms, domestic abuse calls, larceny, arson of park land, prohibited ATV use, assault, and reports of sexual misconduct. Heat-related emergencies make up the bulk of emergency medical calls in the summer months.\r\n \r\nThe park is the eastern terminus for the Mountains-to-Sea State Trail. At roughly a square mile, no area of Jockey\'s Ridge could be considered backcountry, however the unforgiving nature of the sand dunes in the frequently occurring conditions of extreme heat, extreme cold, and high winds require that the dunes be treated as such. \r\n\r\nThe park has oversight over a hang gliding concession vendor (currently Kitty Hawk Kites) who pays a percentage to DPR for the rights to operate the concession. Currently the contract specifies a guaranteed amount of $ annually. A sliding percentage scale is applied to any amount over $. Last year, revenues from the contract were $. The concession is not without its requirements of our staff, who respond to hang gliding accidents, monitor the administration of the contract, and maintain the facilities leased by the school. A 2007 economic impact study by NC State University found the economic impact to the area caused by the park to be approximately 15 million dollars.\r\n\r\nBecause Jockey\'s Ridge State Park was started as a grass roots effort by the local community, locals are impassioned and fiercely protective of it. The community depends heavily on us as an economic draw for tourism, and we play a major role in the daily lives of locals and visitors to the area. As the most-visited attraction in the Outer Banks, any reduction in educational efforts, natural resource protection, recreational opportunities, or visitor protection and safety would likely have a tremendous impact on area residents, tourism, and the economy of eastern NC.'),
(697, 'HARO', '     Hanging Rock State Park is open every day except Christmas.  Maintenance and office staff cover 7 days a week 8-5:00.   Rangers cover two shift  and during summer add a third shift to match lake operation hours.  The park is open for day use 13 hours in the summer, 12 hours in spring and fall, and 10 hours in the winter.  Last year there were only 30 days when there were no overnight guests.  Rangers respond to after-hours emergencies and to non-emergency visitor needs. Maintenance staff is called in after hours to repair facilities and equipment that cannot wait.\r\n     Due to reduction in force in the last 5 years, one office assistant and one maintenance mechanic were lost.  Remaining staff absorbed extra responsibilities to continue visitor services.  Staffing levels allow the visitor center to be open only 7 hours a day, inadequate for visitor demand.  Volunteers assist with extending visitor center operations but are an unreliable labor source.\r\n      Rangers patrol 7200 acres in hazardous mountain terrain, 20 miles of trail, and one mile of river all accessible only by foot.  Search and rescue incidents, wildfires, emergency responses ranging from minor injuries to deaths, misdemeanor and felony arrests, citations, and traffic collisions occur in all seasons.  Staff respond statewide to wildfires, searches, natural disasters and staffing needs in other parks.  \r\n     One main entrance leads to the visitor center, maintenance compound, campground, cabins, lake and trailheads. Five satellite areas with their own parking areas and facilities are from 5 to 15 minutes away from the main park area. All of these accesses require patrol for visitor and park safety.  Staff absences due to vacancies, leave, and training leave inadequate personnel to complete patrol at all visitor use facilities daily and meet maintenance and visitor services demands.\r\n     Rangers led 197 interpretive nature programs and 8 teacher workshops to 4392 park visitors in 2013.  Saura Indian Native American Primitive Tools Day and Reach the Peaks trail endurance hike are part of the intensive special events managed by park staff.  Park staff managed 23 events through permits in 2013. 536 fifth graders from Stokes County attended Environmental Awareness Days field trip event with rangers over a three day period.\r\n     Rangers manage natural resource projects including Hemlock Wooly Adelgid treatment and monitoring, prescribed burning, removal of exotic invasive plants, monitoring of rare species and removal of hazard trees.  They do boundary line marking and patrol to deter hunting and encroachments.   Permanent staff manages a temporary staff most of the year that peaks at 24 during the summer.  Tasks such as opening and closing facilities, registering campers, reservations, cleaning restrooms, campsites, buildings, shelters, grass mowing, and trash and litter removal take place daily. The Office Assistant handles duties such as hiring administration, scheduling, bank deposits, and paying bills.  Preventative maintenance to buildings and facilities is ongoing on aging infrastructure.  Maintenance mechanics complete and administer major maintenance projects, capital improvement projects, manage contracts, and complete most maintenance and repairs on a fleet of vehicles, tractors, mowers and equipment.  Water, well, and sewer systems must be monitored for leaks and problems. One maintenance mechanic has certifications in Subsurface System Operator license and C-Well Water Treatment Facility Operator license to maintain legal requirements for wastewater and drinking water systems. Revenue is generated by renting facilities, permits, souvenir and firewood sales. The park is the premier attraction in the county, and many businesses cater to the tourism industry around the park. Studies show that park visitors heavily impact the local economy.  Staff works in cooperation with business, tourism boards, local government, Arts Council, schools, local law enforcement and emergency agencies, the Park Advisory Committee and Friends of Sauratown Mountains. \r\n');

The park contains three islands (Bear, Huggins, and Jones Island) which are accessable only by boat.  These islands are patrolled daily by staff in order to provide public assistance and to protect natural resources and park facilities.  The park operates three shifts and is open 364 days a year. \r\n  \r\nHammocks Beach has four park ranger positions who develop and present EE programs. In 2013, 754 programs were presented to 19,958 participants.  Ranger staff manage 15 natural resource management projects each year which include monitoring and managing two projects that involve endangered species.  In addition they hire and supervise up to ten seasonal employees in park operations.  Two Office Assistants operate a 7,000 sq. foot visitor center 9 hrs. a day with duties that involve answering phones, selling ferry tickets, registering campers, dispatching ferry and park operations, and a vast amount of clerical work.\r\n \r\nA seven month ferry service is operated by the park which includes three maintenance staff who maintain five ferry vessels, supervise 3 ferry crews, adhere to USCG inspections, and who serve as auxiliary ferry operators.  Four park rangers patrol three islands and the mainland 7 days a week providing law enforcement and first aid services to over 130,000 park visitors a year.  Staff perform maintenance on 15 buildings, 4 boat docks, 3 boat lifts, 6 trucks, 2 UTV\'s, and 10 boats.  In addition they provide staff support for ferry operations and staffing for special events.  \r\n\r\nBased on a seven day a week service the park operates a ferry service to and from Bear Island seven months of the year.  Last year our ferry attendance included 25,858 passengers and a total park attendance of 135,701 visitors on the mainland.  During a seven day work week 4 rangers are needed in order to provide a law enforcement presence and first aid service on a remote barrier island.  Our staff handles all law enforcement and emergency situations.  In addition two other islands are patrolled, along with 8.5 miles of paddle trails.  Ranger staff also provide transportation to the beach front for ADA ferry passengers.\r\n\r\nLast fiscal year Hammocks Beach State Park generated $127,815.21 in revenue.  The park is a tourist attraction for Onslow and Carteret Counties and supports the four local communities by drawing vacationers into the area.  \r\n\r\nThe Park currently works with the \"Friends of the Hammocks and Bear Island\", the \"North Carolina Coastal Federation\", the \"Swansboro Rotary Club\", the \"Swansboro Area Development Foundation\" and the \"Swansboro Area Chamber of Commerce\".  \r\nEach year the park is used by different community groups for special events.  These events draw revenue into the community \r\nand the park and include the following:  Military Appreciation Day, NC Paddle Festival, Pirate Fest, Swansboro Rotary Fishing Tournament, Swansboro Mullet Run, Trunk or Treat and Marsh Cruises for a Cause.  \r\n \r\nAt the present time Hammocks Beach State Park has one vacant ranger position.  This position is the Lead Interpretive Ranger and Safety Officer for the park.  If this position is not filled then the park will have to reduce the number of educational programs offered, and decrease the number of resource management projects that we currently conduct.  In addition there will be gaps in operational coverage on Bear Island and other park areas in providing visitor protection and safety.\r\n'),
(700, 'GRMO', 'Due to the remoteness of Grandfather Mountain the current staffing of the Park Superintendent, two Park Rangers, one Maintenance Mechanic and an Office Assistant, as well as five seasonal staff, are a critical part of park operations.  The park borders the Blue Ridge Parkway and the private Grandfather Mountain Attraction (GMSF). There are multiple access points separated by 23 miles.  Evacuation of a patient from an interior park trail can take state rangers and local rescue up to 12 hours.  None of the trails within the park are vehicle/ATV accessible.  \r\n\r\nThe park staff often works together with a variety of outside agencies.  Due to limited access and rugged terrain, local fire and rescue, law enforcement, National Park Service rangers, GMSF staff responds to medical and/or law enforcement emergencies within the park.  The park\'s Superintendent and rangers work in conjunction with the NC Wildlife Resource Commission, NC Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Nature Conservancy and GMSF in protecting threatened and endangered species and natural resources from poachers.   \r\n\r\nGrandfather Mountain is open 365 days/year.  All of the parkâ€™s visitors are hikers or backpack campers: our attendance counters are located at trailheads, counting foot traffic.  During the winter months, the park still receives quite a few hardy hikers.  Throughout the year park staff works opening and closing shifts in order to cover park operations that include monitoring back country hiking trails and campsites.  During the main season, May through October, ranger staff work two different shifts â€“ opening staff work from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm to monitor opening operation and the closing ranger will work from 12:30 pm to 9:00 pm to monitor the closing operations.  All trails and campsites are accessible by foot only: there are no internal roads in the park, so a substantial amount of time is spent on the trails.  Throughout the year our ranger staff has a variety of roles that include patrolling and maintaining the parks, trails, providing EMS and search and rescue services.  In addition, ranger staff provides education programs to the public, both on- and off- site, and monitors significant natural resources.\r\n\r\nThe park\'s maintenance mechanic maintains the 12 miles of trails and 13 backpack campsites, Hi-Balsam shelter. The maintenance mechanic also plays a vital role in EMS and search and rescue operations due to the remoteness and ruggedness of the trail systems.  \r\n\r\nThe office assistant provides the public with fast and friendly responses, either in person, on the telephone or via email during business hours year round.  The park\'s office assistant ensures that all paperwork, deposits, invoices, reports etc, get done in a timely and accurate fashion.  During the busy season of May through October, the park has a seasonal office assistant to cover the office operations during the weekends; which frees up the ranger staff for LE, emergencies, programs, etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the staff at Grandfather Mountain also manage the expanding Yellow Mountain State Natural Area.  This new natural area requires regular monitoring and patrol to address historical uses of hunting and ATV use, mark newly acquired park boundary, and meet with adjacent landowners and land conservancies.  \r\n\r\nThe park\'s current staffing does not cover the bare minimum needed to cover park operations seven days a week and to provide the public with the best possible service during their visit to the park.  Two rangers and one superintendent are an inadequate number to cover opening and closing shifts 7 days/week.  Due to limited staff, all park staff works together to maintain park operations, whether it is maintaining trails, assisting with grounds upkeep or manning the office.  The public feels the effect of a limited staff by a limited number of interpretive programs, rangers not patrolling trails as often as expected, new boundary not being marked.  \r\n'),

All of which must be regularly patrolled for both visitor safety and protection of the state\'s resources. With access areas spread so far apart, and missing Ranger positions regular patrol and maintenance is a challenge to maintain. \r\n\r\nGorges provides many environmental education programs based on staff availability to general park visitors, school groups, civic groups, scout troops, civic groups and outreach programs. The new visitor center has a 75 person auditorium and 40 person classroom as well as an extensive exhibit hall.  With adequate staffing these facilities could provide a number of more educational opportunities for park visitors.  Park staff are very active in the community, serving on the Chamber of Commerce board, Transylvania Count Natural Resources Council, Tourism Development Authority, and the Foothills Trail Conference board. Gorges is an important and active member of the Transylvania County community.\r\n\r\nNatural resource management at Gorges is dynamic due to the size, location, terrain and natural characteristics of the park.  Park staff maintains over 24 miles of designated trails, 7 of which are equestrian / mountain bike trails, multiple miles of mountain trout streams, and over 50 miles of park boundary. The park is home to over 26 natural community types, 46, rare, threatened or endangered species. The park is also active in Hemlock Wholly Adelgid treatment and monitoring.  Gorges also maintains an easement for South Carolina to the Crossroads Mountain area of SC on the north side of Lake Jocassee.\r\n\r\nOperation and maintenance of facilities include the parks Gold level LEED certified visitor center, maintenance facilities, two major entrances separated 14 miles apart, 16 primitive back country campsites, multiple trail heads, picnic areas, two restroom facilities, and 2 96-person capacity picnic shelters.  Park staff often complete major maintenance & trail projects in-house to save money and create a better product for park visitors.   At current staffing levels, routine patrol of the park is extremely limited. Routine shifts leave rangers working independently for extended amounts of time which dramatically reduces not only response times but adequate park coverage. Rangers often are required to respond to isolated remote areas with limited backup. Officer safety is always a concern in such a large varied operation with such limited coverage.\r\n\r\nRevenue generation has grown dramatically with addition at the Visitor Center retail shop.  Sales last year exceeded $45,000.  Demand for camping is high and a planned family campground will be a great revenue generator for the park and community.\r\n\r\nAdministration of the six permanent positions and five seasonal positions and all daily business needs fall to the Park Superintendent and one Office Assistant.  From the original 7,029 acre park with very limited facilities to the current facilities and acreage listed above park staff has not kept pace with the current business and visitor need.  Over the past five years, four critically needed positions have not been realized.  These include: one Office Assistant IV, one Maintenance Mechanic IV, and two Journey Park Rangers. Full utilization of the new Visitor Center, classroom and auditorium with programming opportunities has not been realized, due to a lack of adequate staff levels.  Current staff work very hard to cover all the operational and visitors needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),
(702, 'GOCR', 'Established in 1974, Goose Creek State Park contains 1,672 acres of land made up of pine ridges, hardwood forest, lowland swamps, creeks and estuaries. Situated on the Pamlico River, with major creeks on either side, the park boundary consists of six miles of shoreline and seven miles of terrain. Activities in the park include camping, hiking/jogging, swimming, picnicking, boating (motor boat, canoe, or kayak), fishing, and in depth nature study. Hours of operation are 8am-9pm June through August 8am-8pm September, October, March, April, May and 8am-6pm November through February. Goose Creek State Park provides one of the last accessible swim beaches on the Pamlico River. This feature draws many visitors who enjoy a day of swimming without the expense and consumption of driving to the coast. We also provide boating access to the Pamlico River and beyond with our Dinah\'s Landing access. Dinah\'s Landing is a satellite area of the park located within our boundary but seven miles from the main gate.\r\n\r\nPark Rangers are responsible for the safety of the park visitor, protection of the parks resources, providing interpretive and educational programs to encourage awareness and good stewardship of our environment, resource management activities, search and rescue, and a wide varity of other task as they occur. These three are responsible for carrying out their responsibilities over the approximately 4,170 hours each year the park is open to the public and being available when campers are onsite. They must work in shifts to cover these hours often working alone in the park. They also must patrol over 11 miles of park trails and roads, 13 miles of boundary, three waterways including the Pamlico river shoreline, and numerous facilities. \r\n\r\nThe park Environmental Specialist is responsible for documenting, and restoring the parks natural and cultural resources, removal of harmful exotic invasive species on over 45 acres, the park\'s prescribed fire program encompassing over 900 acres, providing educational and interpretive programs on issues that promote good stewardship of natural resources, and conversion of 282 acres of pine plantations into a natural longleaf pine community. This position is also responsible for the National Natural Landmark (one of only 13 in the state) designation which encompasses 227 acres of pristine marshland located in the park.\r\n\r\nFor the entire park we have two Maintenance Mechanic positions. They must maintain all the park\'s facilities, infrastructure and grounds listed above. They must also maintain park vehicles, 2 tractors, 4 mowers, and numerous pieces of small engine equipment such as weed eaters and chainsaws. Many park projects are completed \"in house\" by maintenance and ranger staff working together. This ultimately saves funding.\r\n\r\nThe parks one Office Assistant position ensure the State\'s financials are in order by promptly paying bills and completing deposits, responding to inquiries from visitors and administrative staff, assisting with camping reservations, assisting park staff with reports, purchasing, and time entry among many other task that keep an office running smoothly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe Park Superintendent position is ultimately responsible for all of the above. By doing so, it provides a high quality experience for the visitor while ensuring the tax payers money is put to good use. The Superintendent\'s goal is to ensure the park as a whole is well taken care of by capable staff. This in turn attracts visitors and provides great memorable experiences which promote healthy outdoor recreation and encourage good stewardship of North Carolina\'s landscape. The Park Superintendent also works with the non-profit Friends of Goose Creek to foster support and promote the park. The Goose Creek State Park, Park Advisory Committee, made up of members of the community, also supports the park to help meet the needs of the public.\r\n\r\nThe staffing levels of the park have been reduced over the past four years to our current level. At this time we are working with a vacant Park Ranger position which has caused reduced programming, even more multi-tasking between staff and slowed progress on our natural resource restoration.'),
(703, 'FOMA', 'Fort Macon State Park is North Carolina most visited State Park with an annual visitation of 1.2 million visitors.  The park is staffed 364 days a year. During the summer months the park is open 13 hours a day requiring employee work schedules to vary (shifts 8 -5 to 12:30 -9:30). Law Enforcement - With the limited law enforcement staff, the employee patrols the park regularly and frequently alone with no other law enforcement ranger on duty.  Park staff responds to all law enforcement, emergencies, and maintenance not only during operation hours but also after hours. Park Rangers are certified in Search and Rescue and with the park\'s high visitation the entire park staff respond regularly to missing child reports. Staff is always on call for State wide response to emergencies and events.  Fort Macon State Park has multiple visitor access.  The Fort Access has an annual visitation of over 700,000 visitors and the Bathhouse (Swim Beach) access with over 500,000 visitors.  Part of Fort Macon State Park is located on an adjacent island only accessible by boat. In addition the park manages Theodore Roosevelt Natural Area which is ten miles from Fort Macon. Environmental Education - Fort Macon State Park provided over 1000 educational programs last year with nearly 70,000 visitors.  School as far away as the State of Indiana visit Fort Macon for educational programs in addition the park provides outreach services to all the local schools in the region. Even when fully staffed the park can not meet the demand or request to provide environmental education programs for schools and other groups. In addition park staff maintains the Fort\'s artifact collections.\r\n\r\nThe park staff manages all the Natural Resource Management needs of the park in wildfire suppression, eradication of invasive species, nuisance animal management, providing accurate resource management information to park visitors, clearing and marking of park boundaries, and work with the Army Corp in placing dredge material on park beaches to offset the erosion caused by the shipping channel. Each employee is responsible for assisting with monitoring internal and external threats to the park.  Park staff maintains and repairs 26 building and structures throughout the park.  Three Maintenance staff members maintain a Waste Water Operational License certification to maintain six septic systems in the park. By law, the park is required to have a certified operator on-site as well as a back-up operator on-site.   Maintenance staff maintains a 180 year old historic fort making sure the fort is not only maintained, but in a accurate historic manner.  In addition,they maintain all equipment, vehicles and grounds of the park. The entire park\'s staff assists in managing seasonal staff and assigned community service workers.

Park staff supervises seasonal lifeguards during the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe last economic impact study showed that primary purpose, non-local visitor (24% of total visitors) spend an estimated $12,105,587 while visiting the region.  The states operating budget for Fort Macon State Park signifies an investment.  Part of the return on this investment is the economic impact created when visitors choose Fort Macon for their recreation.  A measure of that return is in the leverage ratio,or the number of dollars generated for local residents for every dollar invested by the state in net operating costs.  For Fort Macon State Park, that ration is 1:13.8.  Therefore, local residents receive a benefit of $13.80 for every dollar the state invests.\r\n\r\nPark staff works very closely with the Friends of Fort Macon and the community to ensure Fort Macon State Park has a positive image and is respected by the citizens of North Carolina.  Last year the park with the help of the Friends of Fort Macon was able to secure $122,670 in donation from the public for the park.  These donations ranged from funds for advertising to $90,000 in construction funds for the new educational pavilion.  The park staff worked closely with the U.S. Coast Guard, Friends of Fort Macon, Boy Scouts and the community to receive 6750 volunteer hours to assist park staff in the maintenance and operation of the park.\r\n'),

Distance from the furthest access points is 27 miles and 48 minutes of driving.\r\n    \r\nOPERATIONS: All positions as well as a private concessionaire are responsible for the operations of the park providing, environmental education, natural resource management, operations, maintenance, administration, visitor services, law enforcement, safety, and emergency response. \r\n\r\nVARIETY OF RESPONSIBILITY:  The height of the parkâ€™s environmental education programs offered was 520 programs and 16,954 people in attendance 2013, natural resource management includes fire management, wild land fire fighting, invasive exotic species management, inventory and monitoring of endangered and threatened plant and animal species. Maintenance includes mowing, landscaping, cleaning facilities, preventative maintenance of facilities, minor to mid-level repairs of facilities and equipment, water/septic system maintenance, trail work, facility safety, and major maintenance and capital improvement projects.  Emergency response from 2008 to 2014 includes 646 documented actions, including safety inspections, training, evacuations, basic life support, advanced life support, emergency medical services, carry outs, deaths, body recovery, investigations, entrapments/rescues, larceny, violations of state law, arrests, property damage, search/rescues, and wildfire.  The year with the highest emergency responses included 68 emergency medical calls.  \r\n\r\nVARIETY OF TERRITORY METHODS OF PATROL:  The park has seven trails totaling 3.65 miles.  These trails travel across numerous structures and take visitors up along cliff faces, cliff lines, and the top of cliffs.  These trails are patrolled and maintained on foot.  The park has multiple backcountry logging roads and legacy trails that total 25.89 miles. These areas are patrolled and maintained by staff through hiking and using off-road and on-road vehicles and equipment including ATVâ€™s, UTVâ€™s, and 4x4 trucks.\r\n  \r\nREVENUE PRODUCTION:  The contractorâ€™s gross revenue high was $ in 2010,  The state park revenue high from this contract was $ in 2010.  \r\n\r\nCOMPLEXITY SIZE OF INFRASTRUCTURE:  The park is over 100 years old, and it has not be maintained or built to state standards with regards to all infrastructure.  Some issues and certain conditions are in need of immediate attention or possible park closures may occur.  A contractor assists in the operation of this park, and there is a contract that has legal ramifications if certain conditions are not met by the state or the contractor.      \r\n\r\nINADEQUATE SERVICES DUE TO STAFFING LEVELS:  Based on the above work load factors, current staffing levels are insufficient.  State park responsibilities and services, such as environmental education, natural resource management, maintenance, law enforcement, and emergency response, cannot be met without assistance of contractors and volunteers.  First, based on current staffing levels and the size of the park, basic levels of law enforcement and emergency response service must be augmented with support from local responders and officers in four counties to meet the demands of this park.  Second, the large volume of operational and major maintenance issues requires extensive augmentation from the concessionaire, maintenance mechanics of neighboring parks, contractors, and volunteers. Third, the historic educational and event services of the park cannot be maintained at this current level without concessionaire staff dedicated to this field of operation. Fourth, natural resource management is not being met at this current staffing level due to the volume of emergency response, daily operational oversight of concessionaire, extensive marketing and promotion involving educational and event services, and management of major maintenance and capital improvement projects. \r\n'),

Emergencies:  medical first responder incidents, arson, wildfires from natural sources, intrusion alarms, elderly couple living in the Park under a Life Estate, power outages, storms, assist with motor vehicle accidents adjacent to park access areas.  Maintenance: responses to failures or issues at all park facilities in all areas to include: electrical power, both city and well water sources and water lines, plumbing, security lights, gates, fences, door locks, and so on.  Also: vehicles to include LEO, fire trucks, and maintenance vehicles all critical to park operations 24/7.  \r\n\r\nAccess Areas and Entrances: -Multiple: Long Valley Farm and the Sandhills areas; currently the Long Valley Farm is the only area open to the public.  There are at least 17 road accesses throughout park property with nearly all gated or maintained in some manner to control access.  -Satellite areas: none.  -Distance and travel time: from park office at Long Valley Farm access area to the Sandhills is an average of 7 miles with a 15 minute drive time.\r\n\r\nVariety of Responsibility: -Environmental Education: Newly opened park in a much underserved area (Fayetteville) we are providing outreach and on-site education to schools, civic organizations, Ft. Bragg, and others.  Sponsoring an AmeriCorps service position primarily for educational purposes.  Highly significant cultural, historical, and natural resources that the public greatly desires interpretation and educational programs to be presented upon.  Education is critical to the maintaining all these resources in a healthy and sustainable manner.  All staff plays a role in providing education to the public.\r\n-Natural Resource Management: The Park has 4,330 acres of the critically rare Sandhills ecosystems with a huge variety of plants, animals, and habitats.  There are large areas of wetlands, multiple creeks and streams, one large lake, and 6 ponds.  Many areas of the park are in various stages of restoration.  There is a large Ecosystem Enhancement Project that has restored about 1 mile of wetlands and stream habitat.  The primary method of maintaining the Sandhills ecosystem is with a prescribed burn program.  All rangers and most maintenance staff are trained in wildland fire suppression and prescribed burning.\r\n-Operations: With only two ranger positions, keeping the park covered with permanent LEO, medical, and fire response staff is not possible.  Large acreage, over 55 buildings and structures, open to the public, and attempting to create and build a new park, operations is complex and varied.  -Maintenance: Is significant with more than 55 buildings, park office, two occupied residences, large shop, 8 vehicles, many miles of roads, wells, water lines, hazard tree management, a lake requiring management of water gate system, and more.  Many of the buildings are historically significant and in need of repairs or renovation to maintain their value and potential use.  -Administration: As a new park all routine administrative needs are required coupled with putting into place the foundation and framework of all related administrative needs.  -Visitor Services: We have been open since Sept. 9, 2013 and have had over 36,000 visitors who are very excited about the park, and the majority of whom are very complimentary of what we are providing at this stage of our development.  Most visitors express a desire and support for further park development.  -Law Enforcement: This Park is in a large metropolitan area that includes over 60,000 military personnel as neighbors.  Fayetteville and Spring Lake are documented high crime areas.  Discussions with local parks and recreation department staff confirm they experience high levels of crime.  A strong ranger LEO presence will be critical to keep Carvers Creek State Park from becoming a high crime park.  -Emergency Response: Current visitor access area is small, but the park is 4,330 acres spread out over many miles.  Local emergencies services will always require park staff to access and respond to any Park incidents that Park staff cannot handle on their own.  Park staff must be maintained to meet any of the many possible emergency incidents to include: search and rescue, medical, wildfire, and law enforcement.  -Statewide Response to Emergencies and Events: Park staff has responded in the last two years to wildfire and storm damage incidents and are prepared to do so in the future however with only two rangers this response will always be limited.\r\n\r\nVariety of Territory, Methods to Cover and Patrol: -Trails: Currently only 1.34 miles of trail open to the public, but parkâ€™s Master Plan calls for over 22 miles of multiuse trails to include hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riding.  Trail system has the potential of being very complex with the urban interface. -Backcountry: About 2/3 of the park could be considered backcountry once development is completed; currently the majority of the Park is backcountry.  Appropriate staffing levels are needed to maintain these areas.  -Waterways: 100 acre Millpond, miles of streams and creeks.  At minimum canoes will be required to maintain Park and have access to all areas. -Hazardous Areas: To include waterways, dam structures/gates, and most importantly more than 50 buildings in various levels of condition from very poor to average.  These are buildings currently not being used, but do have the potential of being very valuable for future Park development and historical preservation.  The primary way to keep the public safe from these building is staff presence. -Vehicles: Park is or will soon be using all the following vehicles to maintain park: canoes, ATV/UTV, 4-wheel LEO and maintenance trucks, two brush fire trucks, mowers, tractor, and a large dump truck requiring a CDL certified staff to operate. \r\n\r\nRevenue Production and Economic Impact: -Currently in our Temporary Development Phase revenue production is limited; however this Parkâ€™s future production can be very large with camping, canoe rentals, picnic shelter rentals, rental of historical buildings, weddings, and others.  Staffing will have to be increased to meet all the operational requirements to provide these services.\r\n-The town of Spring Lake, including the Mayor, has expressed much excitement and desire to support this Park and its future potential because of the positive and significant economic impact they see this park can provide to this area. The city of Fayetteville and Cumberland County have similar feelings and have already included the Park in their tourism management efforts and advertisements.  \r\n\r\nComplexity and Size of Infrastructure: -Legal Requirements- Currently infrastructure is fairly low, but does include both wells and city water, park office, shop, two residents, miles of sand and/or gravel roads, all sewage is currently septic tanks with some upgrades badly needed.  -Visitor facilities: Includes gravel road and 70 car parking lot, park office, multiple picnic sites, fishing access, and 1.3/4 miles of trail.  -Support Facilities: Shop and large vehicle shed (10 bays in the shed).\r\n\r\nComplexity of Community Obligations and Connections: -Connections with city of Spring Lake Mayorâ€™s office, local parks and recreation, Fayetteville Tourism Bureau, Harnett/Cumberland Countyâ€™s EMS, LE, Fire, and SAR, local schools, churches, Boy Scouts, and others.   Ft. Bragg and Pope Airbase: Anti-terrorism office, Pope Air Field Commander (park is on airport approach path), recreation services, schools, fire department, and natural resources department.  Also: Chamber of Commerce, several home owners associations and others. \r\n\r\nReduced or Inadequate Services due to Current Staffing Levels: -With only two ranger/LEO staff position it is impossible to cover all park operational hours during the year.  This also makes covering the park when a ranger is sick, going to training, or on leave very difficult; requests will have to be made for rangers from other parks to assist in keeping park covered.  There are and will continue to be many hours where there is not a ranger on duty at the park, but an off-duty ranger is in the area.  Currently three permanent staff positions are vacant and there are times when the only staff at the park is seasonal employees.  \r\n-There are so many projects, plans, and work to be done because we are a new park, but with only two rangers we are limited to only the highest priority items.  Further development of the Park will require more staff, especially park rangers.\r\n-Some areas of the Park cannot be patrolled frequently enough to address illegal use such as dumping of huge amounts of trash/construction debris, illegal drug use, party spots, arson, vandalism, and damages from off road vehicles of several types.  \r\n-Boundary encroachment and boundary marking and maintenance are very difficult to attend to with current staffing levels.  \r\n-Many natural resource management projects such as invasive plants and inventory projects are only minimally addressed.  \r\n\r\n'),
(717, 'CLNE', '  Cliffs of the Neuse State Park (CLNE) (+/-1,200 Acres) and Sandy Run State Natural Area (+/-2,500 Acres) are both operated and managed with an eight-member permanent park staff.  Park visitation for the most recent 2012-13 fiscal year was approximately 225,000.  Cliffs of the Neuse State Park (CLNE) is open to the public 364 days per year being closed only on Christmas Day.  Sandy Run State Natural Area (SARU) is managed by Cliffs staff and requires routine maintenance and patrol by commissioned staff.  In most seasons, two shifts are needed to fulfill open hours of the park day, with one commissioned staff member available after hours daily.  \r\n  Two gated entrances permit access, with the park\'s main gate off Park Entrance Road being closed and locked daily at posted closing times.  This gate controls access to all facilities except for the group camping sites area.  The entrance to the group camping sites area is kept locked at all times, however, it is left open while registered campers are in the group sites. \r\nProtection duties on CLNE are assigned to all on-duty rangers with the closing ranger assigned to facility and visitor security (after-hours emergency response) after 1700 hours each day.  Rangers regularly patrol boundaries, park roads, trails, and parking areas.  One ranger is assigned to SARU due to the 55-mile driving distance although all commissioned staff rotate for patrol duties during the six-month long hunting seasons that run on adjacent properties.  Search-and-rescue operations and first responder response to medical emergencies are handled by commissioned staff initially at all times.\r\n  The park\'s only office assistant handles all front-line visitor services by managing campground reservations, facility reservations, handling all public phone inquiries, and all initial general public program requests.  Maintenance staff ensures that all areas open to visitors are properly cleaned and safe.  Ranger staff routinely check for hazards on all trails, at the park\'s 11-acre swim lake, and is assigned to front-line visitor services in both campgrounds.\r\n  The park\'s superintendent and office assistant ensure all budgetary documentation is filed per division policy and all budget tracking with respect to maintenance and expenditures is followed.  Scheduling, time entry, and staffing matters for permanent staff are handled by the superintendent while the office assistant handles the same duties for the approximately nine (9) seasonal employees of the park.  The three-month operation of the park\'s swim lake, open both to swimming and for concession purchases, is handled entirely by ranger staff including supervision of a seasonal staff.\r\n  Park Maintenance is handled by one (1) Maintenance Mechanic IV who is assisted by one (1) Maintenance Mechanic I.  These positions perform all vehicle and equipment upkeep, all building heating and cooling monitoring, all water line maintenance, all cleaning management, and all grounds upkeep.  Additionally, CLNE maintenance staff makes regular trips to SARU to maintain roads, boundaries, and gates.  The park\'s second Maintenance Mechanic IV position is currently assigned to the division\'s sign shop but regularly assists staff when short-handed as at present.  \r\n  Over the most recent 2012-13 work cycle CLNE staff rangers delivered more than 150 public Interpretation & Education programs, with the majority of those being delivered to school-age children on-site.  The rangers regularly lead paddle trips on the Neuse River adjacent to the park and interpretive hikes and other programs for the general public on weekends.  Natural Resource Management conducted on the park over the past year has included five (5) prescribed burns on different areas of the park in an effort to reduce the hazards of uncontrolled wildfire.\r\n  Included within the acreages given above, CLNE has approximately one-and-a-half miles of river frontage on the Neuse River with a new paddle launch pending two miles upriver from the park boundaries.  When currently approved trails are completed, Cliffs of the Neuse will have approximately 5 miles of trail and will be part of the Mountains to Sea State Trail.\r\nAt present, CLNE features a 1,000 square-foot auditorium available for reservation, an 11-acre swim lake, a food-and-beverage concession at the swim lake pavilion, a 34-site family campground, a four-site group campground, and 800 square-foot picnic shelter also available for reservation.  The new Visitor Center has a walk-through museum area and the park features three parking areas for the general public.  \r\n  CLNE currently has a Maintenance Mechanic I vacancy, a situation that has severely limited grounds maintenance, facility repair, and projects completion.  The MMI position typically supervises general utility workers, park attendants, and volunteers and this has placed excessive duties and time constraints on the park\'s Maintenance Mechanic IV position.

(718, 'CRMO', 'Crowders Mountain State Park is a 5,216 acre park situated in the southern Piedmont of the state, near the South Carolina State line just south of I-85.  There are over one million residents within a 50 mile radius of the park.  The park has been called an \"urban oasis\" as it provides the only true backcountry experience within a one hour drive of the largest urban area in the state.  The park is scheduled to be open every day except Christmas.  The park has three separate access points.  The main access area is Sparrow Springs, located roughly in the center of the park.  The Linwood Access Area, the northern access point, is a ten minute drive from Sparrow Springs, and the Boulders Access Area, the southern access point (with access into two South Carolina parks), is a 15 minute drive from Sparrow Springs.  Opening staff are required to start their shift at 7 AM to ensure that, with travel, the facilities are opened, cleaned and ready for public use by 8 AM. The closing shift is scheduled until at least 1/2 hour past gate closing time in order to close multiple areas with multiples office/restroom facilities.  The \"closing routine\" takes approximately 1 1/2 hours start to finish.  Park visitors frequently do not leave on time; there is a 50% chance that closing staff will not leave on time year around.  It is not unusual for a Ranger to be required to work three hours past the end of their shift in order to account for the safety of all park visitors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance staff at Crowders Mountain work rotating weekends, year-round, and have job duties not normally associated with typical maintenance staff such as directing traffic, opening facilities, assisting with special events, and responding to emergencies and projects in other parks. For these reasons, the park needs the assigned four maintenance mechanics.\r\nRanger staff at the park have a variety of roles.  Highlights include patrolling and marking 30 miles of boundary, participating in prescribed burns at this park and others, patrolling both park trails and the campground on foot, exotic species control on a park that once was farmland and homesites, responding to extended EMS incidents (including falls with and without fatalities) that may take half the workday, and complete reports for of the above.   The park is currently assigned five Park Rangers and one Park Superintendent. All park staff work weekends, evenings and holidays to provide the needed coverage.  One Ranger position was cut in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe administrative functions at the park are complex.  The park only has one full time office assistant, whose duties include providing all the fiscal functions and administrative support functions, but also is responsible for the total operation of a gift shop.  The park recently had two Office Assistant staff to perform these functions, but lost one due to budget cuts in 2008.  It is beyond critical that the park have at lease one office assistant.\r\n\r\nThe Park Superintendent position duties include coordination with over 6 government agencies in two counties to provide effective law enforcement, EMS and SAR response, coordination with South Carolina state parks with common trail systems, coordination with other trail groups (such as the Kings Mountain Gateway and Carolina Thread trail), and coordination with a very active Friends group to provide for grants and special event financial and personnel assistance.  The job is so complex that, combined with \"Ranger duties\" that the Superintendent provides, the 40 hour work week is often insufficient.\r\n\r\nDue to vacancies, the park is currently short one Ranger, two Maintenance Mechanics and the only Office Assistant position.  The effect of these shortages is that it is extremely difficult to coordinate gate opening and morning cleaning routines (with some areas being opened late and/or cleaned late), the number of public programs offered is minimal, all staff are being required to adjust their schedules and duties on a weekly basis, the fiscal reporting obligations are not always being met on time, and direct visitor contact on the heavily used trails is minimal.  One \"new\" ranger position has been approved for operating reserve specific to the park\'s campground expansion.  As Crowders is one of the most visited parks in the system, deals with multiple public and private organizations, has three distinct, distant access areas, adjoins other parks in other states, and has varied Ranger responsibilities, it is critical that the staffing level at least remain at the allotted level, and that the \"new\" Ranger position, which would replace the one that was cut in 2008, be provided.\r\n');

(719, 'DISW', '  Dismal Swamp State Park consists of 6 full time staff members to cover over 14,000 acres of park property, a visitor center, maintenance area, 1/2 mile boardwalk, 20+ miles of park roads and our unique swing bridge.  Hours of operation are 8 to 6 PM, Mar-Oct and 8 to 5 PM, Nov.-Feb. A minimum of 3 staff are required onsite for basic operations.  Seasonal staff often account for at least one of these 3 staff.  An agreement with the US Coast Guard limits use of bridge access past 6 PM except in cases of emergency. Present visitation is approximately 125,000 but has steadily increased since opening to the public in 2008. \r\n  Access to the park is controlled by a computerized hydraulic swing bridge that crosses the Dismal Swamp Canal (part of the Intracoastal Waterway). An agreement with the US Coast Guard requires the park to maintain a staff member at the bridge when it is in the closed position (closed to boats, open to visitors).  Staff is required to open at the will of the boating public.  Violation resulting in a boater being delayed can result in a $25,000 fine and 1 year in prison.  All park staff are required to be proficient in operation of the bridge. Manual operation of the bridge when the computer system fails requires a minimum of 2 people.  Weather (snow, wind, and lightning strikes), power outages and other issues affect operations.  A backup generator provides power and staff are required to understand its operation and care.  The park tries to keep a maintenance mechanic and park ranger on duty at all times but is not always possible. The park relies heavily on seasonal staff.  All visitors must be accounted for at the end of the day as the bridge is left in the open position after hours and visitors left in the park will be stranded. \r\n  While the bridge is the only public access, the park has to monitor access from the adjacent Wildlife Refuge, private property and access off Horseshoe road.   Boundary marking and patrolling requires 2 staff and takes a lot of time as many areas are not easily accessible, often having to crawl through thick brush.  Due to hunting on the Refuge and surrounding communities, it is extremely important for the boundaries to be properly marked and patrolled for safety.  Staff also assists NC Wildlife and Refuge Law Enforcement on hunting patrols.\r\n  The park maintains over 20 miles of trails that double as park roads.  These are old logging roads that require extensive maintenance.  The staff mow, gravel, fill pot holes and cut back the 20+ miles of roads on an ongoing basis, maintaining a variety of large equipment to do these tasks.  Through an agreement with US Fish and Wildlife, the Refuge helps us maintain some roads for mutual benefit.  Without this help, some roads would not be passable due to lack of staff and equipment to maintain.   Park rangers patrol the trails to assist bicyclists and hikers.  The staff provides medical assistance and search for overdue hikers/bikers in remote areas by 4x4 vehicles due to road conditions and by foot.  \r\n  These roads also act as fire lines/emergency escape routes during fires in the swamp.  Two large project fires (South One Type II, Lateral West Type I) have occurred in the last 10 years.   Wildfires pose a serious threat to the park and the surrounding community.  Staff maintain equipment to put out small fires that often occur and train to work cooperatively with US Fish and Wildlife, NC Forestry and emergency response teams on larger fires.   Presently the park is working on a comprehensive hydrological restoration project in conjunction with the Refuge to restore water to the swamp and decrease the duration of these wildfires.  Similar to work being done in the Florida Everglades and Okefenokee Swamp.   The park is involved in the Great Dismal Swamp Water Management Team consisting of Federal, State, University and resource specialists working on the resource issues of the Great Dismal Swamp.  Recent construction included two new water control structures. ( North American Wetland Conservation Grant)     \r\n  The park rents canoes, kayaks and bicycles to park visitors to increase visitor enjoyment and revenue.  This requires a staff member in the visitor center at all times.  In the spring and fall seasons the park often has all equipment rented. \r\n  The park organizes two large community events, Paddle for the Border in May and Dismal Day in October. The park works with organizations such as the City of Chesapeake, Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, the Dismal Swamp Canal Welcome Center, Camden Tourism Development Authority and Camden P&R.  Staff have sat on the Steering committee for Camden Planning and the Albemarle Regional Comprehensive Bike Committee.  The park has an extremely active Friends Group and is the focal point for our county.  Rangers presented over 450 environmental education programs reaching over 10,000 people last year in our community.  \r\n  Unfortunately due to having one ranger in Basic Law Enforcement Training and one vacant position, recently many of these tasks have been impossible to maintain at previous levels.  The park presently is short 2 of the 6 permanent staff.  Other surrounding parks are assisting by sending ranger staff but this reduces their ability to manage their parks.   \r\n'),

The current staff cannot provide the necessary coverage to adequately staff the park at all times throughout the year, as well as manage the four state natural areas assigned to the park staff.  Three shifts are generally required to provide coverage during the summer season: open, close & mid-shift. \r\n\r\nElk Knob is a developing state park established in 2003, encompassing over 4,200 acres in Ashe, Avery & Watauga counties.  The park is known for the spectacular design and natural beauty of its Summit Trail.  Staying open for snow events, the park is a popular destination for cross country skiing and snowshoeing.  \r\n\r\nA ranger is on standby each night for law enforcement or emergency medical response as needed.  Rangers respond to a wide array of emergencies including injuries, illnesses, missing persons, burglar alarms & incidents of domestic violence.  An entire eight hour shift is necessary to conduct a complete vehicle patrol (125 Miles).  Six miles of strenuous trail is patrolled either on foot or by UTV.  The park has many exposed cliffs and boulder areas that increase the chance of major injury.  \r\n\r\nOn any given day an employee might give a bear program, build a trail, participate in bog restoration, issue a permit, repair a vehicle, reconcile a purchase, answer a visitor question, conduct an arrest, rescue the injured, or deploy to a wildfire on the other side of the state.  \r\n\r\nFacilities include an office, maintenance area, restrooms, two public vehicle areas, three hiking trails, six campsites & two civil war era cabins.  The park recently began efforts to collect revenue with the opening of new campsites in the backcountry in the fall of 2012.  A park gift shop will open in February of 2014.  The Elk Knob Community Heritage Organization was vital to the establishment of the park in 2003.  The park hosts their Headwaters Festival each year by managing security, parking, operations and logistics.  \r\n\r\nContinued growth within the park has not been accompanied by the adequate creation of new positions.  It is not possible to protect or promote the natural resources under our designation with current position levels.  The park needs additional personnel for patrols, emergency response, natural resource management and environmental education.  Additional field staff would strengthen efforts particularly at our satellite areas, where the staff are already spread thin.  \r\n\r\nVisitor safety should be taken into consideration, as obvious dangers are present within the park, including extreme weather and terrain.  Should a injury or search occur on state park property the response could be delayed due to weather, terrain, and the isolation of the victim.  A reduction in staff would only decrease preparedness in addition to the response time and efficiency of rescue personnel.  The creation of additional positions with close proximity to our natural areas would increase response times to emergencies, while providing the public with a growing number of recreational opportunities in a safe environment.

(721, 'ENRI', '     Eno River State Park is an urban/rural interface park with both the challenges of a park in the wilderness and a park in the city.   There are 6 different primary accesses to the park.   These are Fews Ford, the Cole Mill, the Cabelands, the Pleasant Green, and the Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area, all of which have gates and facilities opened and closed daily.  There is also the Pump Station Access, which does not have a gate, and six neighborhood access trails that afford the ability to walk directly into the park.   Eno River State Park staffing through reduction-in-force has been reduced from 11 to 8 personnel in recent years, insufficient to provide protection, maintenance, and visitor services for all visitor use areas daily.\r\n     The park is staffed 365 days a year.  The park is open daily 13 hours in the summer, 12 hours fall and spring, and 10 hours in winter.  Two maintenance staff works generally Monday through Friday from 7 am to 4pm.  Four ranger staff and the park superintendent covers both opening and closing shifts with the closing shift exceeding closing time to conclude park operations and respond to visitor emergencies.  To meet visitor needs, rangers work split shifts as required.  All rangers are expected to respond to after-hours emergencies.  In 2013 there were 19 ranger call outs to respond to after-hours incidents.  \r\n     Eno River State Park rangers lead and supervise an average of 320 educational programs a year, averaging 8,000 people annually over the last five years.  This includes general public programs, large school groups, requested programs tailored to the user group, and large scale events like the Festival for the Eno, International Migratory Bird day, Earth Day, and Take a Child Outside Week.\r\n     Eno River rangers monitor and maintain 42 miles of marked park boundary line.  Staff is actively involved in the Eno River Hydrilla Technical Advisory Board and the large scale Hydrilla threat to the river.  Park rangers directly and through management of temporary staff and volunteers, survey, monitor and engage in control attempts on 12 species of exotic invasive plants.  Rangers monitor several significant Natural Heritage areas and several native species listed as significant element occurrences.\r\n     Seven park employees are certified first responders and trained for basic wildfire response, and five are commissioned law enforcement officers.  Over the last 5 years on average rangers have responded to  12-18 EMS calls a year, have conducted 15-20 searches a year for lost or potentially lost people, have issued 50-70 citations a year (most for alcohol or drug related offenses in the park) and have made 2-5 arrests a year(most for larceny, drug offenses or outstanding warrants).  These prosecutions require follow up court appearances.  Rangers investigate an average of 13 larcenies, breaking and entering, and motor vehicle accidents annually.  Over the last five years park staff have responded to and extinguished three wild land fires.\r\n     The Eno River Association, is the oldest public land trust in North Carolina.  We maintain a very strong relationship with them and do frequent partnerships and outreach with them, including the Festival for the Eno, the Annual Eno River Run and the I-Walk the Eno summer camp programs, and collaborate on natural resource management issues and land conservation.  We regularly partner with local schools, universities, home-school groups, businesses and private organizations to foster educational and volunteer opportunities.  Park staff supervised and supported over 2000 volunteer hours in the park last year.\r\n     The park staff is called upon to assist with law enforcement, search and rescue, wildfires and other critical incidents across the state while continuing park operations.  \r\n\r\n'),
(722, 'FALA', '     Falls Lake State Recreation Area consists of 7 individual recreation areas, a marina concession, one natural area and two administrative areas, most that must be opened and closed daily.  It takes approximately 20 minutes to travel between the farthest recreation areas.  The natural area, Mitchellâ€™s Millpond is over 1 hour round trip from the park office.  Each recreation area is in itself a small state park with varying visitor use facilities and infrastructure.  The park is open to the public 7 days a week, 364 days a year, 10 hours a day in the winter, 12 hours in the spring and fall, and 13 hours in the summer.   Falls Lake has 30 permanent staff positions covering 7 separate parks.   For operational effectiveness  the staffing is divided into 4 groups with each group having the following allocations:\r\nRolling View â€“ Multi use park with picnic shelters, swim beach, boat ramp, hiking trails and camping â€“ 3 rangers and 2 maintenance staff;\r\nSanding Beach/Hwy 50/Beaverdam â€“ swim beaches, boat ramps, hiking trails, mountain bike trails â€“ 4 rangers, 3 maintenance staff;\r\nHolly Point â€“ camping ground, hiking trails, boat ramp â€“ 2 rangers, 3 maintenance staff;\r\nShinleaf/BW wells â€“ camping, hiking trails, boat ramp â€“ 2 rangers, 2 maintenance staff.\r\n     Falls Lake has a sophisticated infrastructure.  All areas have complex permitted fresh water and waste water systems that must be operated by licensed and certified personnel.  Falls Lake has two certified staff to oversee the entire system.  When staff shortages occur in this area and malfunctions occur, the probability of permit violations and facility closures can be expected.\r\n     Maintenance staff responsibilities include day to day maintenance and upkeep of all grounds, facilities and equipment.  They are also involved in completing any major repairs and construction. Falls Lake maintenance staff are trained in medical first responder, wild land fire suppression, and chainsaw operation.  Some are trained in search and rescue.  The loss of two maintenance positions to reduction-in force over the last 9 years has resulted in an increased reliance on contracting the maintenance projects out that would otherwise have been handled in-house.   This results in delays in grass cutting, routine maintenance and major repairs or renovations of facilities.\r\n     Rangers have the primary responsibilities for interpretation, law enforcement, search and rescue, emergency medical response, and natural resource management.  Over the last 5 years rangers have issued an average of 405 citations and conducted an average 161 educational programs per year.  Due to the number of public use facilities in relation to the size of maintenance staff, they assist with routine maintenance tasks such as bathroom cleaning, trash pickup and grass cutting.  Recreation areas collect large amounts of revenue through facility rental fees (shelters, camping) and entrance fees during the peak season.  The Rangers oversee the operation of entrance stations, including temporary employee management and revenue handling.  4 of the 7 recreation areas have overnight camping facilities.  After-hours emergencies are handled by placing law enforcement rangers on standby.  In 2013 there were 129 after-hours call-outs.  Although the main water body of Falls Lake is not within our jurisdiction, due to our proximity park rangers are routinely called upon by local agencies to respond to medical emergencies on the water and assist wildlife officers with law enforcement.\r\n     The parkâ€™s current staffing allows only basic maintenance and law enforcement coverage to be maintained.  Medical or vacation leave, vacancies, and training result in a deficit of coverage.  The loss of one Ranger position to reduction-in force exacerbated the situation.  The park staff is called upon to assist with law enforcement, search and rescue, wildfires and other critical incidents across the state while continuing park operations.  \r\n'),
(726, 'CABE', 'Carolina Beach State Park (CABE) is a unique coastal attraction that is home to one of the world\'s most unique carnivorous plants, the Venus flytrap. Over 500,000 visitors a year come to enjoy the park\'s secluded 83-site campground beneath towering trees, hiking trails that traverse a variety of distinct habitats and a 54-slip marina & boat ramp facility that helps anglers access some of North Carolina\'s best fishing spots. The park is open to the public daily w/ the exception of Christmas Day. Park operational hours follow the below schedule:\r\n\r\n8 am â€“ 6 pm	 	November - February \r\n8 am â€“ 8 pm		March, April, September and October\r\n8 am â€“ 10 pm		May - August \r\n\r\nTo cover the daily operational need, park rangers at CABE may work an opening 8:00am-5:00pm shift, with a rotating requirement of a closing shift that is 11:00am - 8:00pm during the months of March, April, September and October and 4:30pm-10:30pm during the heavier visitation months from May through August. Of note is the fact that the 10:00pm closing time is later than most other state parks. This is due in large part to the dynamic range of tourist activities (ie: beach, museums, restaurants, historic sites & special events) available for visitors to the area. While many visitors utilize Carolina Beach State Park as a tourist destination in and of itself for boating, hiking, fishing, nature study and camping, the addition of so many attractions and activities outside the park offers a multitude of entertainment opportunities at nearly any hour of the day.\r\n\r\nPark rangers are required to live in park residences where available for the protection of state assets and as first responders in the areas of visitor safety, emergency medical and even maintenance for guests that are in the park overnight camping or utilizing the park\'s marina for overnight transient dockage. CABE documents after hours responses or \"call-outs\" for its sworn ranger staff. During a recent period from 7/1/12 to 6/30/13, there were a total of thirty-one (31) after-hours responses. Of these, seven (7)were noted as \"EMS-type\", another seven (7) were noted as \"LE-type\" and twenty-two (22) noted as \"Other\". These \"Other\" calls typically relate to visitor unfamiliarity of gate hours, procedures or inconvenience related to weather issues. On numerous, undocumented occasions, maintenance staff is called in after normal working hours for repairs related to visitor safety or customer service for campers or other overnight guests.  \r\n\r\nThe main visitor-use areas and facilities are located within the 761-acre Carolina Beach State Park, located in southern New Hanover County. Small acreage areas (<200 ac. collectively)are located on satellite areas of Masonboro and Lea Islands. Lack of adequate staff time and difficulty of accessibility limits patrols and surveys in these areas.\r\n\r\nPark rangers are on the front line of environmental education and interpretive services for all ages of visitors that come to a North Carolina State Park. Rangers must be able to interpret their natural surroundings, habitats and species for a diversity of people and must relate the meaning and relevance that these things have to residents and visitors to our parks. Rangers must be able to develop programming, but also wayside exhibitry and interactive learning experiences that serve to stimulate folks to learn more. Only recently at CABE, four (4) new wayside panels have been installed and new exhibits have been installed within our visitor center.\r\n\r\nPark rangers must have knowledge, skills and abilities to conduct restorative prescribed or controlled burns on park property for ecological maintenance and hazard control. These burns are often completed solely \"in-house\" w/ little other agency assistance. Where needed however staff does assist other agencies in this regard. Two (2) burns totaling just under 150 acres were completed within the last year w/ an area near the park visitor center and throughout the increasingly rare longleaf pine and wiregrass community and around several sensitive limestone sink ponds. The fires typically take place during spring and early summer to replicate natural fires and maximize the ecological benefits on the landscape, all in accordance w/ the mission of NC State Parks. Park staff does an annual inventory and report of the park\'s Venus flytrap populations for the NC Dept. of Agriculture, Plant Industry Division, w/ assistance of UNCW research students. Staff must be wary of poaching which is a constant concern of these and other rare plants, but also must maintain familiarity and management knowledge of diverse resource management subjects such as: waterway erosional factors, salt water intrusion, exotic/invasive species removal, herbicide treatments, reptile surveys and wildlife management, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nAs special peace officers w/ state-wide reach and a variety of associated abilities, state park rangers must be ready to respond to emergencies such as wildfires, hurricane events or snow/ice storm deployments that can happen in any section of the state. Many parks have unusual circumstances and surrounding facilities that require action by rangers on occasion. At CABE, the nearby Brunswick Nuclear Plant offers risk management and emergency training that rangers attend. In the event of a major emergency or warning signal failure, area agencies, including CABE rangers serve as a primary, manual notification source for the community. \r\n\r\nCABE maintains seven (7) miles of trails in a diversity of habitats. Several of these locations include hazardous, or potentially hazardous areas along Snow\'s Cut and the Cape Fear River, each of which serve as an \"inland waterway\", officially called the Intracoastal Waterway. Currents are strong and unpredictable here which has led to accidental drownings in the past. Staff has assisted agencies w/ search and rescue of these waters, as well as body recovery. Survey and patrol of park areas in emergency situations and otherwise, may be by boat, UTV, automobile or other means. Rangers must be able to operate tractors, chainsaws and other specialty equipment when the need arises and often on a re-occurring basis. 310 acres of the park is actually federal property that is leased from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) or the Department of Defense (DOD). DOD operates one of the largest munitions depots in the United States, just across the river from the park at Military Ocean Terminal - Sunny Point(MOTSU). The portion of park property is termed the \"blast zone\" or \"buffer zone\" and is unable to be developed because of the potential for disaster. Rangers must complete daily work tasks in extreme weather conditions in the midst of venomous snakes, poisonous plants and disease-carrying insects. All of which occur with regularity at Carolina Beach State Park. \r\n\r\nRevenue production for a period covering July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nPark staff developed new Kayak and Stand-up Paddleboard (SUP)rental concession to provide new recreational services to the public while providing a new state park revenue stream. The park worked with the Department\'s Purchase and Contract Section to develop, advertise and award contract. Services first offered to the public near the CABE Marina location on July 8, 2013.\r\n\r\nPark staff maintains and operates a modern visitor center with exhibit hall, auditorium, park offices and restrooms. Three (3) washhouse or bathroom buildings with the park campgrounds and picnic areas. A modern, recently renovated marina complex hosts boaters from the smallest fishing vessel to 40\' cruising vessels. A marina store is available here at the marina complex, also restrooms, a laundry and lounge is available for transient boaters, boat ramp and other day users. This facility is a check-in location for campers and often serves has first point of contact for visitors.\r\n\r\nPark Staff works closely with film companies, NC and Wilmington Film Offices in planning film projects. Three (3) such projects with television and major motion picture shoots took place in the park over a period from 7/1/12 to 6/30/13.Importance of following DPR film permit guidelines, special activity permit provisions and use of facilities while also ensuring the protection of the park\'s resources and visiting public was stressed with production teams.\r\n\r\nWilmington Road Runners Club supports various park projects and equipment purchases with their annual \"Turkey Trot\" cross-country run on park trails. The November 2013 event had over 250 participants. Funds are administered by the club treasurer and requests made by the the park superintendent. Numerous volunteer individual and groups perform community service and other related support activities as a service to the park and in order to complete community requirements. 1,137 hours were tallied during a period from 7/1/12 to 6/30/13.\r\n\r\nCommunity groups that park staff offers programming for includes: Yahweh Center, Issac Bear Early College, Coastal Horizons Learning Centers, Martin L. King Center, Marine Quest Summer Camps (UNCW), AAI Learning Center and many more.\r\n\r\nCurrent staffing level includes one (1) vacancy. This is the Maintenance Mechanic III position which serves to perform a variety of tasks at or near the journey level. MM III serves to maintain grounds, facilities and equipment and assist in basic custodial responsibilities, trail maintenance, mowing/trimming, basic auto mechanics, refuse collection with expertise in at least one trade. Maintenance Mechanic III maintains certification as a Subsurface Water Pollution Control System Operator with yearly renewal of continuing education credits as required by county and state regulations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n'),
(727, 'SILA', 'Singletary Lake is the only state park developed primarily for organized group camping and is comprised of 649 land acres and a 572 acre lake.  The park manages two camps; Camp Ipecac, which houses up to 92 persons, was built in the 1930â€™s by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Resettlement Administration.  Camp Ipecac, teeming with historical value, is comprised of 11 cabins, 1 staff cabin, a bath house, a mess hall and recreational ball courts.  It is open from April 1 to November 1.  Camp Loblolly Bay welcomes an additional 48 persons to its facility which consists of 4 cabins, a bath house, a mess hall and recreational ball courts and is open year round.  An Educational Building is utilized for Interpretation and Educational programs for the group campers, public programs and meetings. These facilities in themselves require much attention from staff as the 2014 reservation calendar for the camps are already reserved at full capacity for the summer months and 90% of the weekends are booked at this time.  Along with the general upkeep of these facilities; pier, canoe launch, trails, large fire rings, roadways, parking areas and the nature hut are also maintained for visitor use.  Singletary Lake lies within the 35,975 acre Bladen Lakes State Forest and requires boundary patrol by ATV and lake patrol by boat for visitor safety.    \r\nSingletary Lake State Park operates seven days a week, 364 days per year and staffs one park superintendent position, one park ranger position, two maintenance mechanic positions and one office assistant position.  The park currently has two full time positions that are vacant.  The vacancies of the maintenance mechanic III and the office assistant leave the park without 40% of the workforce needed.  It is critical that all positions are filled because we not only operate Singletary Lake Group Camp but also manage White Lake and Bay Tree Lake.  These vacant positions are putting a strain on the normal duties performed by staff.  Environmental education, law enforcement patrol, natural resource management, training responsibilities, state wide response to emergencies, events and day to day operations are suffering because of the extra demand of office related and maintenance duties.          \r\nThe managed areas, Singletary Lake, White Lake, and Bay Tree Lake, are all part of the unique Carolina bay ecosystem that is found nowhere else in the world.  Shifts required to operate these areas are typically 8 hours per day but often require after hours response for law enforcement, searches, medical emergencies and maintenance related response.  Both White Lake and Bay Tree Lake are satellite areas and are accessible to the public 24 hours a day 7 days a week and therefore require emergency response when it occurs.  Singletary Lake also needs 24 hour monitoring/standby as overnight campers occupy the camps.  White Lake is 10 miles from Singletary and is approximately 1,068 water acres.  It requires regular patrol, routine maintenance, monitoring for hazards and monitoring for invasive species.  Management of 576 owners/agents that are permitted for piers, buoys, ramps and/or swim lines is also necessary.  All permitting of these facets are required to be processed through our office.  The same management is necessary for Bay Tree Lake (1,418 water acres) which is located approximately 12 miles from Singletary and encompasses 59 owner/agents with piers, buoys and ramps.  In addition to the lake monitoring and management at Bay Tree, 609 acres of land is also managed.\r\nSingletary Lake State Park supports a large variety of community groups such as scout troops, church associated groups, special interest groups, school groups as well as the general public.  The park is affiliated with the Friends of Bladen Lakes which supports park efforts to reach out to the community.  Revenue is generated by the park through group camp rentals, educational building rentals, state lakes permitting and annual fees.  Singletary Lake State Park has many attributes that make it a distinctive destination for park visitors.  The sheer history behind the Civilian Conservation Corps Camps along with the unique one of a kind Carolina bay ecosystem make this park an unprecedented area to operate and experience. \r\n'),
(728, 'LURI', 'Lumber River State Park is located in southeastern North Carolina. It\'s service area is all four of the counties that the Lumber River flows through- Scotland, Hoke, Robeson, and Columbus counties.  The river itself is 115 miles long, all of which are included in the NC Natural and Scenic River System and 81 miles of which are in the National Wild & Scenic River System.  It is one of only four rivers in the state in the National Wild & Scenic river System. The park\'s facilities include two main access Areas, Princess Ann and Chalk Banks, for drive-to visitor access. These two access areas are 50 miles from one another.  The public also has drive-to access to the park\'s Big Sandy Ridge property, which is open for the public to access the property on weekends.  The park is composed of 11,064 acres, making it the fourth largest in the state park system. This includes the above three properties along with multiple outlying tracts that encompass the additional 8,000 acres of property included in the park. The park has an annual visitation of approximately 65,000. The park has a series of seven canoe-in campsites situated along the length of the river for boaters to enjoy overnight trips along the entire length of the river. The park has a total of 5 miles of hiking trails and five miles of equestrian trails. The park hours of operation are from 8am-6pm during November-February, 8am-8pm during March, April, May, September, and October, and 8am-9pm during June-August.  Park staff is very frequently working in the park much later than these hours checking campers and assisting visitors with their needs. Park staff is composed of one Superintendent, five Rangers, two Maintenance Mechanics, and one Office Assistant. One Maintenance Mechanic works at each of the two major park facilities.  Each one maintains all the buildings, equipment, and facilities including trails, campgrounds, day use areas, picnic areas, and grounds at their assigned access area. In addition each position is responsible for maintaining all of the facilities, property, and grounds for the 8000 acres outside of these two access areas.\r\nAlthough there are two access areas, one Office Assistant manages all the vital administrative and budgetary duties of the entire park, in conjunction with the Park Superintendent.\r\nPark staff conducts several rescues each year of overdue or injured boaters in distress on the river.  Most of these involve necessary after hours call outs in which all available staff respond. As these situations frequently occur at night and several miles from available access points along the river, multiple responses have to occur at different access points along the river in an attempt to reach the victims quickly.  This can involve assistance from local emergency response and law enforcement agencies, as needed. In addition to the law enforcement aspect of the Ranger positions, all Lumber River Rangers and Maintenance staff are certified as First Responders with additional CPR/AED, Search and Rescue, Wildland Fire Fighting, and ICS/NIMS certifications to provide park visitors with a response, if needed, that gives the safest experience possible.\r\nIn addition to responding to emergencies within the state park system all across the state , including Chimney Rock, Pilot Mountain, and Morrow Mountain recently, Lumber River staff have responded to all requests the State Park System has received from the state Emergency Management office, including sending the majority of the staff to wildfire responses in the northeastern and eastern part of the state as requested by the Division of Forest Resources and Hurricane Irene response for an extended deployment to Hatteras Island.  These are preceded by Lumber River staff responses to the Gates County post hurricane law enforcement effort, and Hurricane Floyd Tarboro area law enforcement response, among others.\r\nLumber River staff participates in the Environmental Field Days for the three counties-Scotland, Robeson and Columbus- that conduct annual Environmental Field Days every year for all the 2nd graders in those counties. The Robeson Environmental Field Day, along with the Annual Love A Tree Days event, are actually held at the state park. In addition to these there are many other special days which the park staff provides environmental education for the school children of all four counties.  The ranger staff of five provides environmental educational programs to approximately 12,000 participants annually. This includes programs directed towards 5,000 school children each year.\r\nLarge horse rides are held at Big Sandy Ridge monthly.  Approximately 250-300 riders participate in these monthly rides so that over 2500 riders go on these trail rides annually.  Park staff must patrol these rides to insure the riders safety.\r\nPark staff, often working in conjunction with other agencies and organizations, work to control many invasive species which would otherwise cause very significant damage to our state\'s native species populations. Due to the extreme amount of land managed by the park staff, most of which is located a considerable distance form the main access points, the potential for poaching and other illegal activities is high and park staff constantly conduct patrols to deter the illegal taking of the animals protected by the state on park property, and other illegal activities. Park staff also protect the state\'s important native species and habitats by using their training to conduct prescribed burns to restore and protect ecosystems and species important to North Carolina.\r\nPark staff have the difficult task of maintaining the Lumber River in a way that provides visitors with the natural experience they expect but also in a way that provides as very safe experience on this river that many underestimate.  Staff are required to be constantly cutting a path through the down trees that frequently fall across the entire width of the river, so that paddlers do not have to deal with the potential danger of having to cross these down trees in the river. They do this in a way that still showcases the natural beauty of the river, as visitors would expect it to be.'),
(729, 'MOMO', 'Morrow Mountain State Park (MOMO) is the third oldest North Carolina State Park and offers a diverse array of recreational pursuits. A large, facility rich, and well-loved park  built in the 1930\'s, MOMO is operated with a minimal staff, keeping the park clean, offering basic services, and performing critical repairs to keep facilities functional. \r\n\r\nAt 4,742 acres, MOMO is an unspoiled gem abutting the million-person Charlotte metropolitan area. Containing four significant mountains and bordering Lake Tillery; MOMO offers diverse and unique outdoor recreational and educational opportunities in a rugged mountainous setting. Protected cultural resources include Native American quarry sites considered the most important source of stone tool material in eastern North America, a Native American site first investigated by famed NC Archaeologist Joffre Coe, the Fayetteville Market Road, western terminus of the Lowder Ferry, and multiple historical homesteads.\r\n\r\nFor the last 16 months, MOMO has operated with only 3 rangers as 1 Advanced Ranger went unfilled for 11 months. The Journey Ranger position vacated during the in-house promotion is currently being recruited. Due to budget cuts an already understaffed MOMO lost a Maintenance Mechanic I position in 2008 and Journey Ranger position in 2011. Due in part to those losses, preventative maintenance has been deferred and the vast majority of maintenance resources are being consumed by facility cleaning, regulatory compliance, and emergency repair duties. Due to the loss of the ranger position, officers now work the vast majority of their nighttime and weekend hours without backup, poaching interdiction and boundary management efforts have been halted, routine patrol has been drastically reduced and arrests are being deferred so that staff can remain in the park. General public interpretive programming has been reduced, as available ranger hours are spent in operation of the park\'s many facilities, emergency services response, facility maintenance and repair, and mandated training.   \r\nThe park is open every day except Christmas. 8:00 am to 6:00 pm - November to February, 8:00 am to 8:00 pm - March, April, September and October, and 8:00am to 9:00 pm May to August. Campground and cabins are available year-round. Maintenance and clerical staff begin work at 7:00 am each day to provide expanded customer service and to ensure cleaning is well underway prior to the arrival of day-use patrons. Typically, at least one commissioned officer is scheduled to work 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. At least one additional officer is scheduled to work an eight hour shift lasting until one hour past the closing hour. Due to lack of staff, November to March, rangers work alone and from 8:00 am to 7:00pm on weekends. In the summer months, the closing ranger will be scheduled to typically work from 1:00 pm to 10:00 pm, though arrests, patrol activity, searches, etc. will often require the closing officer to work much later than the assigned shift. On busy weekends such as Memorial Day, Labor Day, and the Fourth of July officers are assigned to work additional nighttime hours with scheduled shifts lasting from 3:00 pm to 12:00 am. Due to the lack of available staff, MOMO routinely recruits rangers from Weymouth Woods State Natural Area or Crowder\'s Mountain State Park to provide backup. With the numerous overnight facilities at MOMO, as many as 800 visitors may be in the park each night. The closing ranger carries and monitors a park cell phone nightly to accept calls from park patrons in distress or emergency services dispatchers. Callback to the park to handle noise complaints, missing persons, injured persons, or facilities malfunctions is common.\r\n\r\nMOMO rangers provide over 100 interpretive programs to school groups annually and host an Old Fashioned Days which draws more than 100 exhibitors and thousands of participants. MOMO rangers are actively involved in monitoring and protecting Bald Eagle nests, gathering data on box turtle and rattlesnake populations, and performing a unique white tailed deer translocation project: moving overabundant deer from MOMO to the Qualla Boundary of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.  MOMO has an active prescribed fire program, burning over 300 acres per year. MOMO staff operates a diverse and labor intensive recreational infrastructure. Concessions are offered at the park office, pool bathhouse, and the boathouse.  Rowboats, canoes, and paddle boats are rented in large numbers. Pool swimming is popular, requiring staff presence, multiple lifeguards and hourly water quality checks. 5 separate campgrounds and 6 vacation cabins require staff time to answer inquiries, process and post reservation, clean facilities, inventory contents, etc. Firewood is sold by staff year round. The Lodge is a popular destination for weddings, family reunions, and community gatherings and is reserved almost every weekend of the year. Multiple picnic shelters are reserved each weekend during the warmer months. MOMO is a popular destination for athletic events including large organized bicycle and foot races.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the 66 buildings at MOMO were constructed in the 1930\'s and 1940\'s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and are in need of major renovation. MOMO maintenance personnel operate 4 drinking water systems and 16 waste disposal systems.  Most of the antiquated systems are operated manually requiring daily monitoring and operation of pumps, valves, chlorinators, etc. To facilitate major repairs, MOMO performs a large number of major maintenance and capital improvement projects, requiring staff to identify and prioritize projects, develop scopes of work, and oversee vendor contracts.  MOMO staff handled 35+ of those contracts in 2013. With 300,000+ visitors per year and rugged, treacherous terrain , MOMO staff routinely engages in search and rescue, medical evacuation, and body recovery duties.  Due to the large quantity of overnight facilities, close proximity to urban areas, and adjacent water-based recreational activities, MOMO rangers often deal with intoxicated subjects, alone and without backup.  Accidental death, suicide, domestic violence, assaultive behavior, controlled substance abuse, and weapons violations are some of the most frequently encountered law enforcement complaints.  With over 30 miles of trails, MOMO staff spends a lot of time preparing for and responding to back country emergencies.  Many single track trails are only accessible by foot or ATV.  Staff patrol, respond, and transport victims by truck, UTV, ATV, patrol boat, shallow draft boat, fire pumper truck, and foot.\r\nMOMO is a valuable participant in the Stanly County community.  MOMO has an active \"Friends\" group, is a recreation and educational resource for the local community and is an economic engine for the local economy. After massive storm damage resulted in a two month closure of the park this summer, the local Chamber of Commerce reported a 20% drop in hotel bookings and a corresponding decrease in restaurant receipts and attributed the decline to the park\'s closure.\r\nMOMO is currently understaffed, any additional cuts to staffing levels would require closure of park facilities and significant cuts in services to the public.'),
(731, 'HARI', '     Haw River State Park is unique in that it is the only overnight environmental education and conference center operated by state parks.  The park provides lodging, meals and meeting spaces for up to 180 guests 364 days of the year.  It is staffed from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. when hosting overnight guests, which is 90% of the year.  After hours responses require rangers for law enforcement and medical response, and maintenance personnel to keep facilities and equipment operating.  Law enforcement staffing includes a park superintendent and park ranger.  Current staffing does not afford a ranger on duty at all times guests are in the park.  When both law enforcement personnel are on duty they alternate opening and closing shifts, and work the closing shift when only one is available.  The office assistant is responsible for managing the billing, purchasing, and other administrative duties.  Daily repair and upkeep of facilities, equipment, and grounds requires two maintenance mechanics who also supervise 3 temporary staff. The park staff is called upon to assist with law enforcement, search and rescue, wildfires and other critical incidents and assist with operations of other short staffed state parks across the state while continuing park operations.\r\n     The park ranger provides general public interpretation and education in the park and in outreach to the community, monitoring of natural resources, assistance to park maintenance, exotic invasive plant eradication, and volunteer management.\r\n      Of twelve permanent positions, seven are receipt based dependent on the revenue generated through the conferences and educational programming.  Last year the park generated over  dollars in revenue by hosting over 200 conferences, and over 70 groups for environmental education day long and overnight programs.\r\n     The administrative assistant (conference coordinator) is responsible for managing the reservations of  conferences and environmental education programming.  Two environmental educators develop, coordinate and schedule year round for the extensive education program and manage a temporary educational staff of 11 full time for nine months.  A housekeeper manages the cleaning of all guest facilities supervising a temporary staff of five.  As a residential conference center, Haw River offers all meals for park visitors during their stay.  In 2013 the three full time chefs provided over 42,000 meals to nearly 28,000 guests.  \r\n     In October, 2014 the main general public park area is slated to be opened.  A ranger and maintenance mechanic have been approved through operating reserve to provide visitor services and to provide for the health and safety for the many park visitors anticipated to frequent the initial facilities including new 3.2 mile trail and picnic area, entrance road and parking.  They will be required for maintenance law enforcement, interpretation and education, natural resource management, and operations in the new section as well as assisting staff at the summit conference center.\r\n\r\n');

Woolridge along with Brian Strong and Carol Tingley have been working with various government and non-profit agencies to plan a Northern Peaks Trail.  Minton and Mcelhone were advised that a contract was in place for the planning and creation of a regional/state trail.  Destination by Design completed a master plan, webpage and promotional video in 2017.    \r\n\r\nDivision staff, park staff and ELKN PAC members have attended public and private meetings concerning the Northern Peaks Trail.  The ELKN PAC is supportive of the trail but has concerns for the rare plant communities on Snake Mountain and The Peak.  Park Superintendent Tracy Minton was contacted by the Mountain Times concerning public concerns for rare plant communities.  The Native Plant Society and the NC Plant Conservation Program have organized  opposition to the concept.  The Nature Conservancy will not participate in the project.  In 2017, Park Superintendent Tracy Minton recommended a meeting with DPR planning and trails to form a united message on the subject.    \r\n\r\nThe project was broken into four interest/study areas:\r\n\r\n1) Boone\r\n2) Elk Knob\r\n3) The Peak & Three Top\r\n4) West Jefferson\r\n\r\nThe park superintendent explained to contractor, Destination by Design, that all park lands should be grouped together as DPR and WRC have different missions.  Despite the park superintendent\'s comments Destination by Design moved forward with their initial plan. \r\n\r\nThe Northern Peaks Trail Master Plan was approved by The Watauga County Tourism Authority in November of 2017.  The board approved a contract with Destination by Design to create a master plan for the redevelopment of Howards Knob County Park to include restrooms and a viewing deck.  The board approved an additional contract to develop a signage plan for Watauga County.  Both plans align with the larger Northern Peaks Trail.  The Howards Knob Master Plan was approved in August of 2018 and released to the public for comment during the following November.  \r\n\r\nThe Northern Peaks Trail Steering Committee was formed in October of 2018.  Blue Ridge Conservancy Director Charlie Brady was appointed chair.  ELKN Park Superintendent Tracy Minton was asked to serve on the committee.  The committee met in October and December of 2018 with the trail being signed into law in July of 2019.  Debate continues on the route of the trail.  The NC Plant Conservation Program is lobbying to keep the trail off mountain summits to protect associated flora.  The steering committee is open to all ideas and agrees that the layout of the trail should promote protection of rare flora.    \r\n\r\nIn 2018, an attempt was made to plan/fund the initial section of the Northern Peaks Trail at the Tree Top Game Land.  However, Ashe County was not able to gather enough support for funding of the project.  \r\n\r\nIn April of 2021, Director Dwayne Patterson announced that Governor Cooper\'s bond proposal would include $2,000,000.00 for the Northern Peaks Trail (land acquisition).    \r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Plan Development:\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Park Superintendent Tracy Minton was advised that ELKN was approved for master plan development in 2018.  In March of 2018, Minton held a site visit of the Cherry Tree Farm for PAC members in preparation for master plan development.  In June of 2018, Minton learned that master plan development would begin in August of 2018.  Master plan contractor Equinox introduced the planning process to staff in August of 2018.  Minton attended a master plan development meeting with Equinox and Raleigh staff in April of 2019.  Equinox conducted a site visit at ELKN in April of 2019.  Equinox released the initial master plan for DPR review in June of 2019.  \r\n\r\n2019/2020 Master Plan Meetings with Equinox and/or DPR Planning:\r\nJuly 11th - ELKN Staff Review of Master Plan\r\nAug 22nd - Public Info Meeting\r\nAug 23rd - Coan Farm Site Visit w/ DPR Planning\r\nDec 17th - Public Info Meeting    \r\nDec 18th - Coan Farm Site Visit w/ Natural Resource Management Staff\r\nMar 5th - DPR & Equinox Meeting, Master Plan 90% Complete \r\nApr 6th - Land Acquisition within Master Plan to Include Northern Peaks Trail \r\nJune 24th - Master Plan Released for Final Public Comment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends of High Country State Parks:\r\n\r\nFOHCSP meetings have ceased other than those centered around the New River Canoe Race Committee.  President Robert White advised the group that he would like to step down from the leadership role in 2016, but the group has not been able to find a replacement.  FOHCSP funded new iron ranger boxes for each High Country park.  Additional boxes will be placed as ELKN gains trailheads through the implementation of the Northern Peaks Trail.  In May of 2017, Park Superintendent Tracy Minton proposed that the group issue debit cards for each park for purchases of one hundred dollars or less.  Minton also proposed that seasonal employees receive an exceptional service award and monetary bonus if they are nominated by their park and complete their season.  In June of 2019, FOHCSP issued a gift card to ELKN as an alternative to a credit card.  Seasonal Rebecca Silver received the first ever FOHCSP Exemplary Service Award in 2018.  Meghan Minton was approved as the ELKN Liaison to FOHCSP in June of 2019.  The liaison will focus on improving purchases, documentation, donation boxes, retail sales and communication. \r\n\r\n\r\nOther Meetings:\r\n\r\nUpper Management Meetings:\r\nDirector - Apr 14th â€“ Bond\r\nDirector & High Country Recreation Leaders â€“ Apr 21st - Bond\r\nDeputy Director of Operations â€“ June 23rd - Alcohol Related SAP\r\n\r\nWEDI Meetings:\r\nJuly 14th\r\nOct 14th\r\nNov 16th\r\nJan 11th\r\nMar 18th (Maintenance)\r\n\r\nELKN Staff Meetings:  \r\nJuly 16th\r\nJan 6th\r\nMar 10th\r\n\r\nWatauga County Emergency Management Meetings (Radio Tower Proposal):\r\nJuly 15th\r\nOct 1st\r\nNov 30th (Balloon Visibility Test)\r\n\r\nMary Coan Well, Water Rights and Easement Meeting w/ Mike and Judy Shremshock:\r\nJune 10th\r\n\r\nOvercrowding Meeting w/ Planning & Superintendents:  \r\nMar 4th\r\n\r\nConference of Superintendents: \r\nJan 19th - Jan 21st  \r\n', '* Increase efforts to acquire acreage to connect Snake Mountain, Elk Knob & The Peak. \r\n* Work w/ Green Valley & Hardin Park Elementary Schools to promote environmental education. \r\n* Reclassify a ranger position to supervisory level (ranger II).     \r\n* Reclassify superintendent position due to increased responsibilities.\r\n* Add additional ranger & construction technician positions.    \r\n* Pursue additional items for resale that would advertise the park and create revenue. \r\n', 'Camping:\r\n\r\nCamping at ELKN is slowly increasing.  However, the isolation of the campsites along with campfire restrictions can be attributed to the limited use.  A family campground with pads and amenities is sorely needed.  Backcountry site improvements were approved in 2020 to include bear boxes and fire circles for each site.  The park is on track to permit campfires by the end of 2022.  In 2022, three new backcountry campsites will replace the Zone Camp area due to lack of use.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTrails:\r\n\r\nErosion remains a problem on the Summit Trail.  ELKN was granted $14,000.00 in trails money for repairs to the Summit Trail in the Spring of 2015.  Finding a contractor w/ the capability of delivering the gravel to selected areas was a challenge.  Contractor Carl Campbell began work and completed the project in the Spring of 2016.  The focus of work in 2016/2017 was installing water bars and cribbing in areas where the erosion of surface materials is taking place.  Water bar and cribbing installation continued to be the focus in 2019.  Covid-19 social distance protocols prohibited work on the Summit Trail in 2020.  However, new drainage dips were installed on the Backcountry Trail.  Efforts in 2021 once again focused on the Backcountry Trail.  Drainage dips were cleared with hand tools and loose rock was removed from the trail bed to improve footing.         \r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Upgrades:\r\n\r\nEfforts to upgrade the ELKN Maintenance Area began in August of 2015.  Timber surrounding the maintenance area was removed to dry the ground.  A graveled loop road was installed for access to covered shelters, equipment and fuel.  A new shelter was installed.  Grading for two disability parking spaces at the CXT was added to the RFQ project at the last minute.  The concrete pad at the shop was extended and a new pad was poured adjacent to the CXT.  In 2017, a concrete pad was poured for gas and diesel tanks that were placed in 2018.  Caution signs have been installed along with a boulder barrier around the sides and back of the pad.  Concrete bollards are in place in front of the pad.  A covered shelter and electrical service was installed in 2018.  Tanks were fully operational in November of 2018.  Additional gravel was added to the loop road in 2018 and 2019.  An entrance gate was installed in 2020 to prevent visitors from entering the area.           \r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Needs:\r\n\r\nELKN desperately needs a picnic shelter, family campground and interpretive center to increase attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCovid-19 Park Closure & Reopening:\r\n\r\nPer the request of WEDI, Park Superintendent Tracy Minton contacted emergency management departments in Ashe and Watauga counties for direction in our Covid-19 response.

Black plowed, mowed and bush hogged park grounds, roads, trails and group campsites.  Herbicide was applied as needed on roadsides.\r\n\r\nIn April of 2016, Park Superintendent Tracy Minton began an erosion control project on the Summit Trail.  Cribbing, steps and water bars are currently being constructed and placed to prevent further washing of the gravel surface for the Summit Trail.  Moving forward no gravel will be placed on the trail before these changes have been implemented.  It will take many years to complete this project.  Efforts to add cribbing, steps and water bars continued in 2019.  Maintenance staff utilized equipment to clear and add new drainage dips on the Backcountry Trail in 2020.      \r\n\r\nIn May of 2020, maintenance staff cleared roadside trees from the site selected for our new maintenance area gate.  The gate was installed and operational in fall of 2020.             \r\n\r\nMaintenance Mechanic Ray Black bush hogged all satellite areas as needed throughout the fiscal year.      \r\n\r\nMaintenance staff prepped approximately 25 new signs for installation in the summer of 2021.\r\n\r\nMaintenance staff cleaned up a dumpsite on the newly acquired Sarah Miller Heirs Tract in the spring of 2021.    \r\n\r\nMaintenance staff removed all hazard trees and widow makers from all park areas in spring of 2021.  \r\n\r\nIn winter of 2021, maintenance staff resurfaced the gravel at the Trailhead Parking Area, Summit Trailhead and Summit Trail.     \r\n\r\nMaintenance staff remodeled the gift shop as a result of the pandemic.

Fred Annand, the Director of Conservation Resources for TNC of NC, requested a meeting with planning and land protection via an email on May 7th, 2015.  Superintendent Minton met with Annand and conducted a site visit in April of 2015.  Land Protection, Planning, MORE & ELKN staff visited the property with Annand on July 29th, 2015.  Comments were positive towards purchasing the entire property with the intent of providing trails, access and facility construction.  Director Mike Murphy submitted a request for appraisal in August of 2015.  In March of 2016, an agreement was reached.  The Connect NC Bond committed $216,282.00 to the acquisition.  The properties closed on September 27th, 2017 and were transferred to the state park system.  \r\n\r\nThe following tracts were included in the Cherry Tree Farm Acquisition:\r\n\r\nJames Coan Tract (1) containing 99.513 acres for a consideration of $300,000.

In January of 2017 Eric Moore from the state property office contacted ELKN concerning a gymnasium, office and swimming pool facility the state purchased within Tract 3.  Superintendent Tracy Minton recommended to Eric Moore that the state sale the facility to the adjacent landowners (Terry & Colinda Hendricks) who have managed the building for the past decade.  The Hendricks family was using the facility as an office for her business at the time of the land transfer.  Unfortunately, the family was not able to acquire the property.  Superintendent Tracy Minton wrote the family a letter giving them sixty days to vacate the property.

The grant was one of only three approved, and the 16 acre property was appraised in December of 2014.  The status of the property is unknown.  Unexpectedly there was a death in the family and they no longer wished to sale the property.  Eric Hiegl checks in with the family every now and then hoping they will change their mind. \r\n\r\n\r\nGary Woodring contacted the park office in 2013 and 2015 to express his interest to sell 135 acres of property to the state.  Mr. Woodring intends to build a road within his deeded right of way that passes through ELKN property on Rittle Knob.  Superintendent Minton forwarded the request up the chain of command.  Land Protection, Planning, MORE & ELKN staff discussed the property at a meeting on July 29th, 2015.  Land protection declined to pursue the property with the knowledge that a road may be constructed across park property with a legal right of way. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2013, there was a rumor that the Hall Tract would be a gift to the State of North Carolina, but the park was never contacted to confirm such a transaction.  James Gough, a realtor for Dr. Brent Hall contacted ELKN in June of 2015 to discuss the potential sale of the 186 acre Hall property.

There are several areas within the gap of Elk Knob that would be relatively easy to burn.  There was a wildfire on the Norris Tract at The Peak in August of 2019.  It was caused by a roadside meth lab and dry conditions.  \r\n\r\nPark Superintendent Tracy Minton submitted a draft of the new ELKN Fire Management Plan to Regional Biologist Marshall Ellis in April of 2017.

On May 28th, 2021, natural resource management staff to include Program Manager Jon Blanchard, conducted a site visit to determine how to move forward with management of the property.  The group determined the following steps for future management:\r\n\r\n1) Contract out removal of the Christmas trees to a vendor that will remove them for wreath\r\n   material over the span of several years.\r\n2) Once all the Christmas trees have been removed, contract out the treatment of exotic and/or \r\n   invasive plant species.\r\n3) After examining the understory of the pine plantation, the group determined to leave the \r\n   white pine plantation in place.

Communications confirmed that the victim was enroute to an urgent care facility in Boone.  I immediately conducted a patrol of the area but was unable to locate the animal or hiking group in question.  I conducted follow-up patrols for the remainder of the evening with the same result.  Efforts to locate the animal in question concluded at 2030 hours.    \r\n\r\nAt approximately 1915 hours, I called the victimâ€™s wife, Helen Clark.  Clark reported she was hiking near the trailhead along with her husband, Jefferson Boyer, when they encountered the dog with a group of four hikers.  According to Clark, Boyer stepped to the side of the trail to let the dog pass as the couple hiked near the trailhead.  Clark stated the leashed dog was handled by a small child around the age of seven.  According to Clark, the child was not strong enough to restrain the dog, and the chain leash utilized was likely longer than six feet.  As a result, Boyer was bitten at least three times resulting in two deep puncture wounds on top of the left hand, and an abrasion near the wrist.  There was a significant amount of bleeding.  I was able to speak with Boyer briefly after his visit to the urgent care to confirm that he was in satisfactory condition.          \r\n\r\nClark and Boyer briefly discussed the situation with the group of hikers, likely a family unit.  Clark and Boyer asked the party if the dog was up to date on all vaccinations to include rabies.  The party confirmed verbally that the dog had been vaccinated appropriately.

Ms. Alexander asked if the service road would end at the trail head parking area I stated it did. Ms. Alexander stated she and her hiking companions would be attempting to carry the dog down the service road and asked if someone could assist them.  I advised Ms. Alexander I would be in route with the parks UTV.  At approximately 1205 hrs I made contact with Ms. Alexander and her party. We loaded the dog (Rosie) an approximately 45 lb golden retriever and Ms. Alexander into the UTV and I drove them back to her vehicle at the Summit Trailhead parking area.

At approximately 1508 hours the victim, Megan Leigh Rodgers, arrived at the employee parking area of the park office in a Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Rodgers was in the passenger side of the vehicle where I found her conscience and alert.  Upon interviewing the victim, I noticed an overwhelming smell of alcohol.  Rodgers revealed she had been drinking before she fell and hit her head as she hiked up the Summit Trail, a few hundred feet from the trailhead. \r\nI noticed a small amount of blood approximately three inches above her right ear.  I advised the victim to not move her head and activated ems via telephone.  Upon further interview the victim admitted to drinking three liquor shots and four beers.  At that time, the victim advised that her head and neck felt great and she just \"wanted to go home\".  As a result, I called Watauga Communications and amended the call for a routine response.  I continued to stabilize the victim\'s head and neck until Meat Camp Fire arrived on the scene at 1533, followed by Watauga Rescue at 1535.  Upon their arrival Meat Camp Fire assessed the victim while I gathered information at the scene.  \r\n\r\nThe victim\'s injuries were limited to a small abrasion on her head.  \r\nVitals:\r\nPulse Rate - 86\r\nBlood Pressure - 112/90\r\nOxygen Saturation - 97\r\n\r\nVehicle Involved:\r\nBlack Jeep Grand Cherokee\r\nNC MEGIPOOH\r\n\r\nOL:\r\nNC 38957989\r\n\r\nSince alcohol was involved, I interviewed the driver of the vehicle.

All units cleared the scene at 1547.\r\n\r\nI utilized appropriate PPE to include an N-95 mask during the entirety of the incident.  I interviewed the victim and her party before engaging.  I only engaged once I determined that the victim\'s head should be stabilized.  Victim did not have Covid-19 symptoms and recently passed a lab test.

This visitation (and level of car traffic) goes up every year, and the actual amount of time a person spends in the park to appreciate it appears to go down, at least according to google analytics.\r\n\r\nI-74 is marching south and north to connect at the park. This connection is being celebrated and promoted heavily by the county which wants to attract all the midwestern beach traffic that uses PIMO as a pit stop.  Without continued limitation of traffic entering the park (the automatic gate and shuttle will help) the effect of highway traffic on PIMO could increase even further beyond its current unsustainable level.  It is no longer unusual to have 400+ cars a hour attempt to enter the mountain for much of the day\r\n\r\nAs of the writing of this report, the current Senate Budget proposes spending 4 million on the Bean Shoals access to include stream restoration repairs, 3 steel/concrete bridges over Horne Creek and Camping improvements.  Surry County has spent around 100k of its own funding developing a preliminary design for DPR approval of this concept.  This would alleviate a issue created when this access area was opened to the public in the 1970\'s and subsequent years of limbo as to whether it would be part of the state historic site or remain in the state park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Automatic Gate (Funded, but not bid out), Paved Parking at Pinnacle Hotel Rd lot to reduce overparking and conflicts with parking outside gate. paved Parking at Pilot Creek to reduce overparking and conflicts with parking outside gate.

The shuttle idea, if we cannot negotiate and fund a second shuttle, has limitations if only one shuttle is running, it just can\'t keep up with demand. \r\n\r\nWhen the original park road was built in the 1920\'s, it was as a tourism money maker. When we assumed PIMO as a state park in 1968, the road remained.  No one anticipated or planned for the future. It is past time to plan for a future problem that is already here. If you look at the exponential growth of visitation, and the final connections of a interstate designed to bring people right past the front gate, Pilot Mountain cannot be sacrificed to the car crowd simply because it is in the path of least resistance. When the road is due to be repaved, the summit parking lot should be reduced in size and made into a circle drive, the park road should include a pedestrian lane, and the only passenger vehicles on the road should be a shuttle. Road repaving is due to occur in 2030. We are at over 2000 cars a day every nice weekend day now trying to enter the summit. Many are turned away. 13 years ago 1000 cars would have been a busy day.

DPR declined to allow significant removal of deer by SAP, controlled permit hunt, or other methods. A few deer have been allowed to be removed by WRC staff as part of CWD surveillance testing. CWD has appeared just across the border in Virginia. The asian longhorned tick has arrived in the county and has already caused the death of a couple of cattle (blood loss). The deer herd has no resistance to any epizootic diseases known to affect deer per WRC.  It appears we will have to wait for a course correction of the deer herd due to disease similar to what occurred at STMO, to alleviate the overbrowse of deer on the landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n The parks prescribed fire restoration goals are going to be of limited success at the mountain with the current level of deer browse. All emerging forbs that are not poisonous to deer are typically consumed before they can complete a growing season. Hardwood regeneration with a few unpalatable exceptions is minimal. Pines seem to survive the deer browsing and our pine species like shortleaf, table mtn and pitch pine survive a first year \"clipping\" by deer to resprout.  Grasses also survive due to the silica content, deer do not really browse them. Targeted removal of one to two family groups of deer in a burn unit should be explored, if DPR does not want to permit a large culling. Deer/tick disease should also be a concern both to visitors and wildlife. The continued spread of both larger coyotes and the asian longhorned tick in the area could be a limiting factor on deer and should be a future research effort by WFU.
